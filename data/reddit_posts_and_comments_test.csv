"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/

>This year, our advanced Gemini model operated end-to-end in natural language, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from the official problem descriptions – all within the 4.5-hour competition time limit.","Recently there has been a lot of jazz around the math olympiad. I also saw Terence Tao (IMO gold medalist and fields medalist) use AI to formalize proofs in lean4, but it wasn't as helpful as one would expect if using e.g. Python. He also has some insightful talks on that. Therefore I wonder whether this is the new topic the big labs identified or whether it just become difficult to optimize for more wide-spread use cases, e.g. getting significantly better at coding, writing, less halucinating, etc?",concur
"Looking to hear from medical expert opinion on what could be the next steps for a case history listed below. NGS didnt show any specific markers and neoadjuvant chemo + immuno (Cisplatin + Etoposide + Durvalumab) resulted in stable tumor (no growth either). Is Carboplatin + Irinotecan + Durvalumab (second-line) the right second line treatment? Anything else that can be done to address the metastasis in various sites? Thank!

"Hi everyone, I am here to find a new contributor for our team's project, pruning (sparsity) benchmarks.

# Why should we develop this?

Even though there are awesome papers (i.e., Awesome-Pruning; [GitHub](https://github.com/he-y/Awesome-Pruning), [GitHub](https://github.com/hrcheng1066/awesome-pruning)) focused on pruning and sparsity, there are no (maybe... let me know if there are) open-source for fair and comprehensive benchmarks, making first-time users confused. And this made a question, ""What is SOTA in the fair environment? How can we profile them?""

# Why can PyTorch-Pruning be a fair benchmark?

Therefore, [PyTorch-Pruning](http://github.com/namgyu-youn/PyTorch-Pruning) mainly focuses on implementing a variable of pruning papers, benchmarking, and profiling in a fair baseline.

More deeply, in the Language Models (LLaMA) benchmarks, we use three evaluation metrics and prompts inspired by Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (ICML'23) :

* Model (parameters) size
* Latency : Time TO First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) for computing total generation time
* Perplexity (PPL) scores : We compute it in same way like [Wanda](https://github.com/locuslab/wanda/blob/8e8fc87b4a2f9955baa7e76e64d5fce7fa8724a6/lib/prune.py#L214) and [SparseGPT](https://github.com/locuslab/wanda/blob/8e8fc87b4a2f9955baa7e76e64d5fce7fa8724a6/lib/prune.py#L214)
* Input Prompt : We uses `databricks-dolly-15k` like Wanda, SparseGPT

# Main Objective (Roadmap) : 2025-Q3 ([GitHub](https://github.com/namgyu-youn/PyTorch-Pruning/issues/1))

For more broad support, our main objectives are implementing or applying more pruning (sparsity) researches. If there is already implemented open-source, then it could be much easier. Please check fig1 if you have any interests.

[fig1. Roadmap : 2025-Q3](https://preview.redd.it/69h8sz9z7udf1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=19ad89510f0c4948faec9772606f661cc3eeaa52)

> Since our goal is applying more researches for pruning (sparsity), we are not planning to apply inference engines like ONNX, TensorRT, DeepSpeed, or TorchAO. But applying those engines is definitely a long-term objective, and always welcome!

p.s., Feel free to comment if you have any ideas or advice. That could be gratefully helpful for better understanding!","Great help. I had my first few pubs on pruning (pre-LLMs, so mostly CNN pruning stuff in the Awesome-Pruning repo you mentioned), and we did try to align multiple baselines under the same setting for fair comparison — though in a much more research-ish, spaghetti-fashion way. Having multiple baselines properly aligned, polished, and runnable under the same repo saves a ton of work for researchers and promotes transparency in science; which we both know is kinda terrible in the efficiency field. That said, one realistic challenge is that there will always be a lot of new pruning methods and no small team can keep up with them. Plus, many methods require custom kernels, which can be hard to integrate into a shared environment; let alone keep them fairly aligned. So iiwy I wouldn’t worry too much about the latency/throughput aspect of things but focus on task performance. We did [https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx\_bench](https://github.com/henryzhongsc/longctx_bench), which basically covers some established compression techniques on the KV cache end (pruning, quantization, etc) with a task performance focus, and I’d say the research community took it well. Took us a lot of work to refactor opensourced methods into an aligned pipeline, standardize the config, eval, etc. Nothing as ambitious as yours, but might be worth a quick look.",concur
"I’ve posted like a hundred times, but my mom (59) had fallen on June 9th and has tibial plateau surgery the next day. she also fractured her ankle. she’s been bedridden mostly ever since since it’s a non weight bearing break. In the last week she’s definitely been more awake and alert, but her muscles are definitely deconditioning. She’s likely mild-moderate and still has some nueroplasticity in her, she can learn through repetition, but she hasn’t been sleeping well through the night which is making it harder for her to follow through on exercises and such. It’s so hard. We’re trying our best to get her to be able to walk again at some point and she wants to so bad, and it’s hard to see her not want to or be unable to participate. And I can’t even figure out what the problem is. Can she not tell which leg she can use? Is she scared to hurt herself? Is the movement painful? Is she too tired to understand? I’m not sure. But it’s hard. I want her to walk again so bad and she does too, and it’s hard to see her like this. Her 6 week xray is on Wednesday and we’re told the ankle cast will likely come off, and if her knee is healing well we may get cleared for partial weight bearing or a hinge brace to start some movement, and I m scared. I don’t know if it will help. I don’t know if she’ll walk again. I for so long felt in my bones she would, and I still feel like that, but right now I feel defeated. I feel like she isn’t or can’t try hard enough to help us get her there. And she’s incredibly upset at being bedbound. She hates the depends. She wants to use a bathroom. She wants to go to bed upstairs and take a shower. She wants to go to the grocery store with my dad. And I want all these for her. And I don’t know how to get her there anymore.

"My girlfriend and I have had sex a handful of times and we were both each other’s firsts. The first time only lasted a few minutes mainly because of nerves but also she was feeling pain. We knew it’s normal to have some pain so we didn’t think much of it at first. 

The second time we tried, I could barely put it in even a little bit, and we made 2 attempts before she had to stop because it hurt so much. She cried because she didn’t know why and felt bad and embarrassed. We recently tried again with no success. We kept the foreplay up and we even attempted different positions. Again, we both know that it can hurt the first time and even the first few times , but from what I understand it’s not supposed to be unbearable. 

I told her she should talk to a doctor whenever she sees a gynecologist but her parents can apparently see her medical records and doesn’t want them to know she is having sex so she doesn’t want to ask even though she acknowledges that she should. She says she’ll only tell the doctor if they agree to keep it off record but they’re not going to do that.

I want her to be able to enjoy something she desperately wants to do. Next time we do it we’re going to attempt to use some lubricant, but I think it’s more than that so I don’t have much confidence in it. She has had reproductive problems before but no doctor will take her seriously. Anything you think could help us out? Thank you.","Welcome to /r/relationship_advice.

"On my day 4 of rebuilding myself 
i learnt...
We don't just fear failure, we fear visibility. The idea of people seeing us try, seeing us mess up, watching us stumble as we figure things out… it terrifies us.
So we stay silent. We ""prepare more."" We wait to be perfect before we show up.

But the truth is: if you want to grow, you have to be seen. Seen trying, seen failing, seen getting back up.
You can’t stay in the shadows and expect to make an impact. You don’t beat fear by waiting it shrinks only when you move through it.

If this hits even one person out there who’s been holding back, just know: you're not alone, but it’s on you to show up anyway.",https://preview.redd.it/rinxdp7ne4ef1.jpeg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e19ba0943b48d8f50ec022c43aeb5fbfa661eaa This photo is my wallpaper.

"Every time I tried to reset, restart, or refocus, I failed again. Not because I was weak or lazy but because I didn’t understand why it kept happening.

Today I realized something simple but deep.
The door that locks you in is already open. The person holding you back is just… you.



In my case, the last block between me and my raw potential was social anxiety. I kept thinking I needed another plan, another reset but what I really needed was to act like the version of me I daydream about. The one who is free, bold, and untouchable. I have also shared my lessons from trying on my sub red. 

And here’s the truth I now believe:
Most successful people don’t have their strength by default. They earned it by fighting its opposite.

Rich people often knew deep poverty.
Confident people lived in anxiety.
Kind people have seen cruelty.
Leaders have lived through helplessness.

"My partner and I have been together for almost 8 years, and engaged for 6 1/2 yrs. We have a 2 yr old and I'm also pregnant with our *planned* second child (The planned part is very important). We've recently just moved into my parents house because we've had so many issues with the management at our apartment and we talked it out and decided we could also save a ton of money and pay off debt if we moved into my parents for a while. 

We planned on paying of debt as quickly as possible and then saving up a down-payment for a house. Good plan right? Well I have a history of recurring miscarriages and have already had complications with bleeding and cramping after moving around with this pregnancy so I've been trying to not do too much lifting or moving, which of course is terrible timing with trying to move on a time limit. Because of my limitations, I know most of the packing has been put on my partner and I've continuously have asked for my siblings and mom to go over and help my partner with packing and cleaning because I didn't want it to be all on him.

 He gets stressed out super easily and I know that could be playing a part in this situation, but when we were almost completely moved out he told me that he needed to talk to me and that I wasn't going to like what he had to say. I of course was panicking on the inside and trying not to freak out, but said okay let's talk. He told me that he talked to his therapist and has come to the realization that all his stress isn't coming from just work, but from me. That he's not sure he wants to be with me anymore and that he's tired of ""taking care of me"" and being responsible for me.

 (Gut punch) I cried, but I sat there and listened to everything he had to say about me and how he's been feeling. He said some very hurtful things and I wanted to say a lot of things but I held back because this was his time to tell me how he felt so I was trying to respect that, but it really really hurt to hear what he said. To clear some things up, I'm a stay at home mom, and I'm on disability, so I have a very small set income every month. But I do pay my own bills, phone, car insurance, gas, and some groceries where i can (so I don't fully understand how he's ""tired of taking care of me""). 

Yes, we knew I would be staying home with the kids way before we had our first kid, and we PLANNED our second kid, after 3 back to back miscarriages. So I'm heartbroken and confused where this is all coming from. Yes he's makes way more money than me, and the we majority of the bills and costs are on him, so I understand that he's stressed out, but this feels like it's coming out of nowhere right now. 

so now we're moved into my parents and he's been completely ignoring me. He won't hardly look at me or talk to me unless he needs to or I talk to him first. After the first week of ignoring me, when we were laying down he started cuddling me and we ended up having sex, but then the next day he went back to ignoring me again. I asked him if on his day off he wanted to go out and get coffee with me and spend some time together just the two of us, and he said he didn't think it was a good idea to be spending alone time with me. 

 That kind of did it for me honestly. So, he can ignore for a week, fuck me one night, and then go back to ignoring all while I'm pregnant and suffering emotionally and mentally through whatever this is. I'm scared to be a single mother, but i know i can do it if i have to. But I love my partner and have never even thought of a life without him these past 8 years. But with how he's been treating me I'm starting to resent him and don't know if I should even try anymore. I don't want to be with someone who makes me feel unloved and unappreciated. I'm heartbroken and so angry, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

*edit* The reason we haven't gotten married is because I'm on disability and would lose my medical insurance and benefits immediately if we got married. I have a lot of medical problems and can't afford to lose my medical. We have both basically acted and treated each other like we're already married though.

 I'm not trying to shit talk him because he's the best man I know and has truly cared for me and our son and has always put us first. He's just not acting like himself right now, and I don't know if it's the stress or if he is actually talking to someone else ","Welcome to /r/relationship_advice.

I know real estate gets a bad rap, but some of us are professional and dedicated. Before that, I was a talent agent in London for 20 years and ran my own successful business for 5 of those. In this role I helped shape the careers of writers for popular fiction, non-fiction and tv, theatre and film. I never once lost a client and helped aid many in selling the rights to their works throughout the world.  I represented tv personalities, bestsellers, box office films.

"First time poster and long time lurker. I’m not providing too much detail because I don’t want this to come out before I’ve decided what to do. Husband and I have been together for 4 years. I am 24 (F) and my husband is 28 (M) and his brother is 25 (M). 
I will be using fake names so I’ll refer to my husband as Drew and BIL as Pat. 

When Drew and I first started dating we spent a lot of time with Pat as well since they lived together and he was single at the time. Pat and I formed what i thought was a genuine sibling like relationship. I would help him set up his dating profiles, convos on life and job hunting. After a few years Pat started dating someone and naturally the three of all hung out less To be honest I don’t think Pat and I have had too many conversations alone since he got into a relationship. But like I said Drew is very close with his entire family so we would all still hang out frequently. 

The confession happened at the end of the night when the lights came on and I was looking for Drew. Pat intercepted me and that’s when he “checked me out” head to toe then said he was in love with me. I just stood there speechless, mouth open and looked around. Then he proceeded to say and look at me with pleading eyes “just say it she’s not not here (in reference to his gf)”. Just as he said that his gf started walking towards him and I just walked away in disbelief. I’m not even going to excuse the fact that he was drinking only because i know what he’s like when he’s drunk. In case I wasn’t clear, I have not ever nor do I currently have romantic feelings for Pat.  
 I say all that to say that when he did say he was in love with me that other moments/comments he’s
made over the years that I brushed off now make  sense.
It’s been easy to keep my distance from Pat, with our honeymoon and Pat going on vacation following immediately after ours. He proposed to his gf and we saw them maybe 2 weeks after the fact. I was finally able to confront him because over text he acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. In the confrontation he tried to gaslight me but then ultimately relented and said we would talk about it and he’s never brought it up again. Drew is very happy for his brother and about his engagement. Ive been trying to move past this but every time i see Pat I am reminded of what he said. I feel horrible keeping this from Drew however with how close he is to his family im afraid of all the fall out that could happen and if the blame would somehow fall on me even though it’s not my fault. I can see how many relationship could be ruined by this and I don’t want to see my husband in pain. So im stuck between keeping the peace and maybe in time this will fade or just telling my husband and let the cards fall where they may 

EDIT: Sheesh the point of this post was to seek advice! I am not protecting BIL that’s far from it. My main reason for not saying anything was because I would be upending the entire family I just married into and known for years. Not to mention I have to see my husband be completely devastated by his brother’s actions and it breaks my heart. With that said after reading these comments I see clearly how I need prioritize my marriage and self and everything else will work itself out.

"# TL;DR: UK Government's Final ME/CFS Delivery Plan (July 2025)

**What it is:** The UK government's final cross-department plan to improve care, research, and support for people with ME/CFS in England.

**Key announcements:**

**Research:**

* £845,000 for PRIME - new infrastructure for ME/CFS biomedical research
* £1.4 million HERITAGE study - examining healthcare models for ME/CFS and Long COVID
* New funding opportunity for repurposed medicines trials
* Research showcase event planned for autumn 2025

**Education & Attitudes:**

* NHS e-learning modules on ME/CFS now available (3 modules completed)
* Public awareness campaign to launch by May 2026
* Push for ME/CFS inclusion in medical school curricula
* Development of ""Language Matters in ME/CFS"" guide

**Healthcare & Support:**

* Template service specification for mild/moderate ME/CFS services
* Exploring specialized services for very severe ME/CFS
* Clinical Knowledge Summary on ME/CFS published
* Integration with 10 Year Health Plan initiatives

**For Children/Young People:**

* Updated guidance for education when unable to attend school
* Neighborhood multidisciplinary teams to help with earlier identification
* Addressing inappropriate safeguarding referrals

**Timeline:** Most actions to be implemented between now and March 2026, with ongoing monitoring through Task and Finish Group.

**Notable:** The plan acknowledges past failures, including ""tragically avoidable deaths"" and commits to making these ""never events."" Estimates UK ME/CFS prevalence at \~390,000 people (0.6% of population).

**What's missing:** No condition-specific welfare reforms, though broader disability benefit reforms are underway.","Interesting to see, it's almost like they realise Long Covid statistics going forward are going to be 1 in 2 people worldwide ... compared with 1 in 6 worldwide for cancer. Currently sitting at around Half a Billion worldwide who have had/have long covid in the past 5 years. Again compared with the estimation of cancer cases worldwide in the past 5 years - roughly 30 million .. It's about time governments took it seriously. Better late than never i suppose.",concur
"Hello all, thanks for reading this. I hope it doesn't become too meandering but I suppose I'm not sure where to start.

I (32m) have been with my gf (28f) for over 7 years now. She has long struggled with her mental health, ADHD we thought, though in the past year or so she has now been saying she is autistic (no official diagnoses). We both have our traumas and I have my own bad brain problems, so working through this and supporting her have always been a given for me, and I've never been one to hold any of it against her.

But I feel she's getting so much worse. She will spend entire days in a semi-disassociated state where she has difficulty taking care of herself, eating, or performing any kind of day-to-day obligations. She's always struggled with work, but the past year-and-a-half or so she's begun to talk about how she ""just can't work"" and ""won't work full time unless it's for herself"" (she wants to start a business). As of now, she works 2 days a week which covers her portion of the bills and the basics, but I really fear for our future. We both have ideas, plans, and aspirations, but how does one build toward this if their partner can only work two days a week and is having breakdowns about how \*that\* is too much?

She has this habit of entering this kind of childlike state? I don't know what to call it, I guess. But she will only communicate via whines or gestures, curls up in blankets on the floor, get upset if I try to make actual communication happen, and totally checks out of being an adult, or a partner. I totally understand indulging your inner child, but this will go on for DAYS and I can barely communicate in any real way with her. In these states, she's nearly totally incapable of caring for herself and I enter a kind of caretaker mode. 

The house is filthy, I do all the cooking and do what I can with the cleaning, but I work a LOT and much of the real issues in the house are strictly her stuff, which I cannot really do anything about without risking a meltdown on her part. 

We've talked a lot, these past couple months, about all of this. Our discussions usually (especially if it's an issue I'm bringing up or that she feels responsible for) devolve into her sobbing, shutting down, or getting VERY angry. I feel that I can't talk at all about my issues in our relationship, my feelings, or my needs, without her spiraling like this. 

All of the above, some more than others, has DRASTICALLY impacted our sex life. I have a very hard time feeling attracted to her when she's in these states (especially that ""little"" (as she calls it) state, for obvious reasons). 

We had a bit of a breakthrough lately, and she professed to a lot of shame and guilt. She feels this way about all the ways she thinks she's ""failing"", but doesn't feel like she can do anything about it. And if I speak (gently!) about something she's feeling this way about, she explodes. We both understand this, now, but it hasn't changed. 

We also talked about our sex life and attraction, and agreed to make an effort to engage in that intimacy as we both think it's important. However, she's put a kind of strange (to me) set of rules in place for us. She suggested that we ""act like we're just starting out again"" and ""totally take sex off the table"". She has a kind of process in mind (hugging > cuddling > kissing > etc) and wants to rule anything further off until ""the vibe is right"". I felt a little lost, but I told her I was willing to try. I also told her I wanted to leave that ball in her court (as far as initiating, as I don't know how fast she wants to move or where her comfort level might be in this). But it's been nearly a month now and we've barely even kissed, and bringing it up causes a blowup. I feel like physical affection (forget sex) has become a weapon.

How far is too far, I guess? She's quit therapy (no money, won't work) and has always refused to see a psych, even though we KNOW she's at least fighting ADHD. I have offered to pay for either but she won't commit. At this point, often, when we hit a roadblock she'll just tell me ""it's because I'm autistic"" or she'll pull up a tiktok of someone talking about a symptom of autism that she identifies with, as if she expects it to totally absolve her of responsibility. I try to be understanding, but sometimes it just feels like she's using it as a weapon.

I love this girl, she wasn't always like this and I know she's an incredibly strong and capable woman in there, but I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I want to help, but I know I'm really just enabling. I am trying to leave her to fend for herself more rather than falling into this kneejerk caretaker response, but it's equally difficult to simply watch her go through this. I don't know what to do, and I feel no matter how I approach it, approaching it all makes me the bad guy. I'm tired of being screamed at, or woken from a dead sleep to her slamming around throwing things and yelling at me because I forgot to dry her laundry or she can't find something, I'm tired of navigating a relationship where I feel like everything is a landmine.

I've begun to have literal, real health problems due to stress (not just relationship stress, other stuff too for sure) and get actual dizzy spells and nausea when I hear her come home or I pull into home after work. When she realized she was part of the cause of this, I spent the rest of the night pulling her out of a hole she had spiraled into because she felt bad. Meanwhile, I can't stay on my feet because my head is spinning!

Any advice? How can I help without sabotaging us or committing to this self-perpetuating cycle we're in? I am trying to talk her into couples therapy, but we've tried it before. At this point, I feel so burnt out and emotionally-drained that it's turning into resentment. Thinking about ending it is heart-wrenching, and I'd be so afraid for her if I did, but I can't stop thinking about how amazing it would be to be with someone that gives me as much as I give them, rather than taking advantage and still treating me like I'm not enough. I can't even remember the last time she asked me if \*I\* was okay and I feel so lonely.

TL;DR - long term relationship is stuck in a horrible cycle, I feel more like a caretaker than a partner. What do we even do at this point?

Thank you for reading.","It’s time to take care of yourself and get out of this situation.

"I went to get diagnosed at the start of this year at 22 years old. I ended up getting medicated 2 months later in April and it has been an overall amazing experience. My biggest struggle, which is college, is much more manageable and I am even excelling. I was also working full time during the spring semester, so I have always been busy. Fast forward to the end of May and I am not working because I work in a school district. I ended up finding a part time job and taking a summer class. This means I am at the house with my family much more. My mother doesn’t work so I am around her a lot. 

This is where my issue gets worse. Ever since I went for my diagnosis, my mom has been against it and questioned the validity of it. I have told her on multiple occasions all of the things that have improved, the habits I’ve kicked, explained how debilitating executive dysfunction is, and all of the other things that come with ADHD. 

Now it’s July and ever since summer has started, I hear such hurtful comments from her, but maybe she doesn’t realize what she says hurts me so much. She repeatedly says that “something is up with me”, “you’re dealing with something that you aren’t telling me”, “your whole personality changed”. These comments are all fueled by my ADHD diagnosis. If there is any change in my personality or the way I navigate my life in recent times, my mother scrutinizes me for being different. 

I want to keep this short, my mother who I have been really close with, makes me feel bad about being medicated and makes me feel like an asshole for acting differently. Honestly I can’t even think of the way I have changed, personality wise, so drastically! My girlfriend and friends seem to think I am still the same person I was before I was medicated! 

Has anyone else dealt with parents/family that have been extremely against their journey of dealing with ADHD as an adult? Thanks, I just want to get this off my chest.

"So, I work from home.  My med change has been making things hard lately, and impacting my performance.   
I preemptively sent my boss an email saying that I had noticed my output had decreased, and I was leaving a lot of things half finished and incomplete without realizing it. I then asked for possible accommodations, listing a few options. The one that I stated I wanted and personally find the most helpful are short daily check ins. 



In the past, when I asked for this, he had stated that I shouldn't need a babysitter-- that needing someone to monitor me is unsuitable.  I don't want to be monitored, I want visible accountability at the end of the day to help trick my brain into getting everything done.  I don't know why it works, but it helps me an incredible amount.  



Today, he tried to have me break down **why** I thought it would do any good.  He really spent a lot of time trying to talk me out of wanting that one, and offered adjusting my schedule instead.  I had included schedule change on the list since before he had recommended that, even though I do my best work in the early morning, and I very much don't want that. I don't know how it would fix anything, but he really wants me to take a later shift. I would be the only one working that late, which seems like the literal opposite of what I need. 

  
After I explained that currently, I would like the check in for a kind of reality check, because I can't trust my judgement, he asked how long I would want, and I said I didn't know, maybe two months if everything went slowly with the meds. He stated this would be an unreasonably long time and burden on someone. 

Is it really such an unreasonable request?  Is there anything else I can do by myself? A strong, consistent check in with repercussions of accountability I don't know how to do alone. 

My other coworkers all have adhd or are busy, and don't really want to be accountabillibudies. 

  
","I would also find this cumbersome and too time consuming, both as a boss and an employee. I would be really careful about saying things like ""I don't trust my judgment"" to a boss. Your boss clearly trusts you - ""you don't need a babysitter"" - and you're actively trying to erode that. I do think your proactive approach is a good one, but be more generic - ""I am having some personal problems and I have observed that it's starting to affect my work. Do you think we could schedule a half hour check in on Fridays for the next few weeks to talk about my progress for the week and anything I might need help with?"" Daily check-ins does seem really unreasonable to me. I would also recommend future requests for accommodations go through HR, and you should provide as little info as is legally required.",oppose
"Hi everyone!

I’m pretty sure I’ve shared my story here. My Mom was diagnosed in 2023 and it was right when I found out I’d be a father for the first time. I’m mostly doing things on my own to take care of mom with occasional help from my Aunt. 

My mom, unfortunately, treats me pretty horribly when I’m bringing her to her treatment and appointments and the grocery store, etc. I thought I was explaining what I was doing in a clear way that would hopefully help and would stick (essentially I remind her that my siblings are not willing to help, and I’m doing what she would have done for her mom if the circumstances were the same. Growing up my mom was a true caregiver.) 

But it really isn’t working. Any suggestions or ways to approach things to help her understand that I’m really only trying my best to help her and am not the bad guy that she is making me out to be. 

I love this community and really appreciate all your stories and experiences ","It sounds like you're doing your best during an incredibly tough situation, and that’s all anyone can ask for.

"Location: Illinois


My dad married his ex-wife when I was 17. She was a stereotypical people-user and she told my mom, in front of me, that she taught her daughters you marry for money not love. Dear dad didn't get the memo. He said he made her sign a pre-nup so he thought he was golden and she was so perfect and blah blah blah. She turned him against my sisters and I to the point we really didn't have a relationship for ~13 years, until she filed for divorce and got around the prenup. He said there's a law that let's your spouse work around the prenuptial after 14 years. I don't know. She took everything from him including the inheritance my grandmother left entirely to him with a verbal instruction to divide amongst me and my sisters/his half siblings. Spoilers alert, he kept everything and then shared it with his wife and left my sisters and I to struggle and figure things out on our own. Which we did, but it wasn't easy. 


When they divorced my father also had gotten an Alzheimers diagnosis. When we started trying to help take care of him (begrudgingly on my part, willingly on my sister's) he swore he had taken care of fixing the will. He wasn't too far gone in the diagnosis yet, so we thought he did. Hindsight is 20-20.


My dad passed away a few months ago. My sister has been in charge of his estate and she found out the hard way that my dad never updated his will. The will that he had filled out most recently was thankfully voided because it left 1/3 of the estate to me and everything else to his ex wife. The new one has 1/3 to me, 1/3 to one sister and 1/3 to a 3rd party that won't be revealed to us but no one else in our family has come forth with it, including 2 half sisters who called Just to see if they were the 3rd beneficiary. They were not. Which leads us to ex wife. 


The inheritance is small for us, around $8000 a piece. His pension however is not being given to either of us. I don't know anything about estate law. My father worked for the state and I've been told his pension is like ~$100k. Is there any standing we would have to contest this? I don't even necessarily want the money though of course it would help. But that woman has stolen so much from our family, including the relationship with our dad. She doesn't deserve this.


Thank you.","*I would be shocked if you and your sibs/half sibs have any claim to a pension.* I am not aware of any State Pensions that have Survivor Benefits for adult non-disabled children. There are 50 chances to be wrong so check in your particular state, BUT in the vast majority of cases a state pension provides survivor benefits to spouses, minor children, and sometimes, disabled adult children. Period. *It would not surprise me at all if your Mother had pension rights.* It is extremely common, and a best practice of any Divorce Attorney from the 1970's on, that any kind of pension be dealt with in a Divorce. Maybe your Mom had a deal to forgo the pension in exchange for property or money. The fact that your Mom would (likely) be eligible to receive a portion of your father's State pension would have been dealt with in the Divorce settlement. I don't want to get your hopes up, it would be unusual to not have started by now, like when your Dad first retired rather than have it scheduled to start it upon his death. N.B. There is actually a federal Law for **federal** pensions and how they are to be dealt with upon Divorce.",concur
"I'm starting to wonder if having a really thoughtful, thoroughly filled out profile is working against me?? I'm definitely looking for something long-term and someone intentional but that being said, I'm noticing even in myself that when I review my matches I'm getting a little turned off by the profiles that people clearly spent a lot of time on. Maybe it has something to do with the few dates I've been on with men who had those types of profiles have all turned out to be really intense people that don't seem to be able to navigate the ""get to know you"" phase well. Communicating intentionality is important but I'm wondering if the line between that and overly intense is thinner than I once thought? Anyone else having similar experiences or want to share their perspective?

"Sharing my 6 month journey integrating Aikido’s spiritual warrior philosophy into meditation and daily life. Since January I’ve been training using the principles Morihei Ueshiba built Aikido on. It’s been the most effective mindset shift I’ve had in years and the impact has been huge.

Foster and polish the warrior spirit while serving in the world, illuminate the path according to your inner light. Ueshiba spoke about unifying heaven, earth and humankind in your presence. Which means integrity in every area, physical posture, verbal tone, room layout, time management, and mental focus.

Ueshiba wasn’t just a martial artist. He was a tactician of energy, a philosopher of peace forged in war. He unified spiritual discipline with technical mastery, developing a system where strength isn’t expressed through violence but through precision, internal command and energetic neutrality.

The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body and polish the spirit. From day one, I understood this wasn’t about fighting. It was about not absorbing chaos. About becoming the still point around which noise dissipates.

Your nervous system is your command center. Guard it. Audit it. Reset it daily. Never allow another person to dictate your internal tempo. Don’t meet force with force. Absorb, redirect, dissolve. Respond only when it serves function, not ego. Tactical silence is one of the strongest tools. Don’t flinch in the face of provocation. Anchor yourself. Govern the field. Learn to operate from stillness. Be unshakeable, not aggressive.

True victory is victory over oneself. Ueshiba’s core philosophy dismantles the modern obsession with domination. He taught that our real opponent is internal, chaos, compulsive emotional loops, an undisciplined nervous system. His way was never to overpower others, but to stabilize without force, to integrate without collapse.

He emphasized Misogi, daily spiritual and physical purification. I’ve adapted that into breathwork before input, structured solitude before engagement, cold exposure to rehearse resilience. These aren’t self help rituals. They’re simulations for high pressure environments. Because in extreme situations the entire universe becomes our foe. At such critical times, unity of mind and technique is essential, do not let your heart waver. This practice has redefined my understanding of readiness. It’s not about fast reactions. It’s about sustained presence.

Six months of integrating training in Ueshiba’s mindset has produced what I can only call combat level awareness except the battlefield is everyday life. When I encountered his teachings, I didn’t approach them as philosophical fluff or spiritual escapism. Aikido isn’t about fighting. It’s about redirecting aggression without absorbing its toxicity. That concept restructured the way I engage with every part of my life. Control of the self, not others is the highest form of power.

Ueshiba had mastered multiple ancient Japanese martial arts swordsmanship, spear fighting, jujutsu but he didn’t stop at technique. His encounters with death, destruction and spiritual practice shaped what he eventually founded: Aikido, the martial art that doesn’t aim to overpower, but to redirect, realign and neutralize.

Ironically it hit me hardest when I wasn’t looking for peace, I was looking for control. Control over emotions, over outcomes, over people who had caused harm. But Ueshiba’s entire life proved that real control is internal. It’s not about dominance. It’s about energetic sovereignty.

He lived through war and loss. He trained his students not to destroy their opponent but to protect even the aggressor from self destruction. That level of mastery, physical, spiritual and ethical is rare. He didn’t teach combat. He taught self possession under pressure. He created a philosophy where you don’t destroy your enemy, you harmonize with their energy, neutralize the chaos and return to stillness.

“True victory is victory over oneself.” This is the cornerstone of his doctrine. It dismantles the ego’s addiction to dominance and turns everything inward.

How can I bring more peace into the space I walk through? That is Aikido. The world doesn’t need more people who can fight, it needs more who can hold, transmute and remain still when everything around them is shaking.

One of his most powerful teachings: “The Way of the Warrior has been misunderstood. It is not a means to kill and destroy others. Those who seek to compete and better others are making a terrible mistake.” True strength isn’t in overpowering, it’s in staying rooted when everything is trying to pull you off center. He created a blueprint for a life of high inner discipline, measured presence and ethical strength.

I entered Ueshiba’s path looking for control. What I found was deeper, energetic self possession. I’m only six months in but I already know this is a lifelong path. Mastery doesn’t come from insight, it’s built through repetition under pressure.

One of Ueshiba’s most potent but under discussed ideas is: "" Do not look upon this world with fear and loathing. Bravely face whatever the gods offer.” That line stays with me.

Winning is the ego’s game. But governing that’s alignment. If you’re seeking real strength, stop chasing superiority. Train for command over self.

"I lost my last 2 days track and I was ignoring the cause of it as it was too 'obvious'. This made me realise:
Most people don’t fall because they were weak or lazy.They fall because they were simply distracted, and the worst part?
They just ignore it or never even notice. 

Many are just looking for some deep-rooted trauma or complicated flaw that’s holding them back.
But the truth is… it’s distraction.
Plain, Simple & deadly but its 'overlooked'

Phone, Lust, Food, Mood swings, Self-doubt & more all can be distractions.
Even overthinking while in work feels like work, but it’s not.

You can sit for 8 hours on a project.
But if 4 of those hours were spent thinking about your future, imagining success, doubting yourself, or fearing failure…
You didn’t work for 8 hours. You worked for 4.

And then you would say “I did so much, why am I still stuck?”
The answer: you were distracted. 

We give distractions too much room to enter & thats why its hard to run from it.
But ever seen a gamer get distracted mid-game?
No. Because their focus has no room left.

The difference is attention.
They close the door to everything else.

So the next time you work, 
Cut the noise.
Shut the mental tabs.
Lock in.

Or don’t complain when distraction steals your day, again.",I am so glad I came across this post. This has totally shifted my perspective & gave me the energy I needed to start my day strong!. Thank you for sharing this :),concur

Magician was super chill. I accidentally walked in on him mid-shower during turndown (because rich people get their beds pre-fluffed while they eat foie gras).

"A few years ago, my sister's friend broke up with someone and she was upset. So, I let her borrow my weighted lavender plushie, and so I let her check out the website that the plushie came from. This sloth plushie was the last thing she was looking at, so I kept the link and was planning on buying it for her. But in the meantime, I crocheted a scarf for the regular plushie she already has and I put some calming essential oils on it. So then, I kept the link for years and never forgot about it. Then, when I finally had enough money, I bought the plushie and I asked my sister for her friend's favorite color. I got soft fluffy yarn in that color, then I crocheted a scarf for it. This plushie is weighted and has lavender in it too, and I put some lavender essential oil on the scarf to help. It hurt my hands to crochet it though, because I had to restart the project a few times and I'm not used to crocheting something that big. I also didn't see this when I bought it, but it said that it was baby blanket yarn. And I kept it in my room until my sister's friend came over again. And then, when I was finally able to give it to her, she was holding back tears of joy. And I told her all about the plushie, how it's microwavable, and can be put in the freezer too. And I suggested she check out the website for any other questions. And then, I also gave her a 3D printed baby wyvern, and she was happy and said that she was actually looking for something like that to put on her desk. And I even helped her sew up one of her comfort items that she keeps on her purse because it was old and had a bit of a rip in it.

"I was diagnosed probably 2 years ago and started taking meds immediately. I also do a lot of independent research so I can fully understand all of my symptoms. Lately, I have been feeling like my ADHD paralysis has gotten worse. It's really only on the days where I take a break from my meds. Before I was diagnosed I had a lot of problems getting up and starting tasks, but I could still do it after I had a brief fight with my brain. Now, on days off of my meds, sometimes I don't get out of bed until noon and I maybe do 1 or 2 tasks. I've been trying to research this and haven't found many resources so I thought I would turn here. I think sometimes community and life experiences can be more useful than scientific research anyway.

The only thing I could really find was about tolerance and dependency. I will admit that I do love my meds. When I started taking them I finally felt like a real person who could do normal things just like everyone else. However, I would be happy to switch if it were in best interest to my health. So, psychologically I don't think I am dependent. Maybe physically I am though and that's why on off days it's harder for me to manage my symptoms than it was before?

"Gf and I ain’t been dating long but she’s got this male friend who has confessed his love for her. 

At first, I had a conversation with her revolving around my boundaries with this and how it makes me uncomfortable that she’d entertain a relationship that is so obviously not platonic. 

They text every day all the time, he does everything she asks of him, and all around he’s just got puppy dog eyes for my girl. 

She’s even introduced me to him amongst a few other of her friends and we said no more than 5 words to one another throughout the entire night. It was obvious from the start he didn’t care for me so I saw no point in entertaining a conversation despite the entire reason I was there was to meet him. 

In an effort that I probably shouldn’t have made, because I know she sees him as her best friend, I told her I didn’t mind them working out together at the gym but I’m heavily against them hanging out one on one outside of there. In my eyes, I was/am making an effort for her to maintain her friendship with this man within boundaries that I find acceptable within myself. 

Issue is, through those boundaries, I have learned he talks shit about me behind my back despite not knowing me. This is what pisses me off. This plants seeds of doubt that she is either too naive to acknowledge or that she is brushing off. This is unacceptable to me at it is directly disrespectful to me and my relationship. 

Additionally, she confides our issues in this man which I am also heavily against. Since their relationship is not platonic, due to him being in love with her, he obviously will say things that can sway her mind away from me little by little at a time. 

Her justification for keeping him in her life is that he’s been there through “thick and thin” for the past 4 years. In my eyes he ruined that “thick and thin” the moment he told her he was in love with her because the motive is different. It’s not a friendship motive. It’s a love motive. 

Anyways, I need advice on how to handle this situation. I’m not the type of man to say she can’t be friends with this man but I am the type to disclose my discomfort and allow her to make decisions based off my discussed discomfort. ","If she's confiding in him about your issues, that's an emotional affair. Man, you don't have time for this, and to be honest, she's too immature for you.

"i'll start by saying i know that i'm young, and i'm not particularly interested in talking about that, i don't want to get into arguments about being ""too young for this"" or embarrass myself by saying i'm ""mature for my age"" because i do handle myself well, but i'm still young and dumb, so i'd rather leave that fact where it is. it is, though, worth mentioning that this guy is my first boyfriend. i've gotten close to dating before but i never found anyone that met my standards (incredibly high in spite of a shitty dad who set the bar in hell). i trust him more than anything. i've trusted him with my first date, my first kiss, my first everything except for sex, i plan to wait on that for personal reasons entirely aside from him. he's literally the first guy to ever hold my hand, as far as i can remember. he's always gone so above and beyond to make sure i feel safe and comfortable whenever we do anything.

i'm autistic, in the way that you couldn't really tell if you didn't know anything about it because i spent 17 years masking without realizing it, but if you squint you can definitely tell. and with that, i'm incredibly direct (part of the reason it also took me 17 years to date). at the start of our relationship, i made my needs clear (emotionally, for the most part, but they kind of bled into sexual territory when it comes to needing to feel safe and taken care of lol) and i wanted to make sure our needs aligned or else i wouldn't want to waste my time on a relationship that wouldn't work. so we talked, which lead to preferences, which led to us dating now and being unbelievably in love in the way that young people always get in movies, and it's awesome and scary and i am obsessed with every second.

the only thing that concerns me is that, in some conversations we've had (i.e., woke up hard because i had a dream about you, let me tell you about it) i've noticed some things that kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

he's been very open with me about past trauma, which i'm very thankful for because i know it's been so scary and that trust is not something he takes lightly, but because of that, it set off... something, in my brain, when he told me he had a dream that i was older than him. (irl i'm a few months younger, whatever who cares.) but when i asked how much older, it was like. 13 years. and i get that some people like cougars, but i know that he was groomed in his younger teen years by a woman in her early 30's. so i told him i didn't feel great about it, and why, and he said i was right and left it.

i thought maybe it was a coping thing and that was it, but he told me he kinda gets off on the idea of me obsessing over him. like, stalker obsession. i told him i was hesitant to indulge the idea because it's every woman's worst nightmare and just a few months ago i had a then-friend who bordered on harassment, and to this day i'm still thankful that i work inside of a gated community. he said he understood, proverbially dusted off his hands like it was nothing, and dropped it immediately. but today during a conversation, i realized that this was another thing. he's had a girl before show up at his work multiple times asking for him, been harassed by someone a few grades down from him from when we were in highschool, and one of his coworkers has directly harassed him and even gone as far to grab him and slap his ass even though SHE has a girlfriend and she KNOWS he has one too. she also kept pressuring him into doing drugs with her and her girlfriend, knowing he's just over a year completely clean, so yeah i'm a BIG fan of her. i hope the earth swallows her whole after he leaves his job next month. when he finally told her off she said she thought he was ""playing hard to get"" but it didn't freak him out any less. i couldn't help but realize that he was getting close to what he had fantasized, i guess, about, just not with me, and he hated it. he was even apologetic and frantic explaining what happened, promising that he didn't want it and that he was so so sorry (he's been made to feel like he ""obviously wanted it"" in past situations, highschool was a total shit show) and i made sure he knew that i know he didn't. i know he hates it, and he has every right to. it's a terrible situation when it's actually happening. he even told me he was nervous leaving work in case she was waiting outside when he clocked out, which i understand. she'd started acting hostile to him during shift, yelling orders at him instead of just punching in tickets. she's apparently incredibly tall and muscular and like 22, maybe? so i get it. to be also fair, he's 5'10, does like 6 sets on the bench with my body weight, and he's a black belt. he's, in the past, put someone in the icu. it's far from my favorite fun fact about him, but it serves to the point: i don't feel the need to worry about him. that, though, doesn't make the fear anyess real.

it just made me recognize a pattern of sexualizing traumatic memories, and not in the ""absent father so i have a daddy kink"" kind of way (me fr we don't need to get into that though.) it's more like, he takes the exact situation he was in and puts it through this sexy, romanticized lense, and i don't feel comfortable indulging it, but i don't know if i should directly discourage it? i feel like i should. it doesn't seem healthy and i don't know where it really comes from. is it maybe a control thing? taking a terrible thing that happened to him and imagining it to be something he can say he liked so it's not as hard to think about? idk. psychoanalysis of my lover aside, they're also just not things i'm really into lol

i like the silly things like randomly taking up a southern accent to give him a boner and laugh at him (lovingly, of course, he thinks it's funny too LMAO), or making out in my backseat listening to goth music talking about if we were vampires, what era would we be from? don't get me wrong, i was exposed to a lot of shit from a way too young age. just because i don't have the first hand experience doesn't mean i'm sexually blinded. immature? sure, probably. unaware? absolutely not. 

i'll also not lie and say i don't get a kick listening to him call me ""sweet girl"" while he bites my thighs, or the way his eyes roll back because i offhandedly compare him to a guard dog. i'll try plenty of things, especially for him, but the romanticizing of extremely traumatic things, and then going to associate them with ME, feels so far from something i even know how to deal with. i guess i have a good start saying i'm uncomfortable, and he's incredibly reciprocal about it and has never brought it up after the first time, until i mentioned the pattern, but i just. idk. i feel like there's something more to say, i just don't know what to say. i feel just a little weird knowing that's rolling around in his brain.

edit: the main suggestion seems to be therapy, so i'll say now that it's not really possible at the moment. his parents don't believe in it (only one of the ever growing number of issues i have with them) so they won't pay for it. they don't see it as a necessity and they already make him feel like he's ""hemorrhaging"" them money because they pay for his insulin and business degree, both equal essentials in their eyes. he can't pay for counseling himself, because he's in that broke college student part of life where he's about to leave his highschool job and he has no promise of one on campus, just applications on the desk of about every hiring manager that place has. i looked into the school's counseling services, and it seems to be just free 20 minute drop-in sessions to vent about your academic stress between classes, so that's something i guess, not really the kind of thing you need to pick apart your sexual psychology.",I doubt the average redditor would be able to be much help.

"A few weeks ago, I made a decision at work that I thought was the right thing to do, but it’s honestly left me feeling kind of isolated and second-guessing myself.

I’ve been at my company for 6 years. Things are stable, I’m doing okay financially, and I’m not in a rush to climb the corporate ladder. Recently, I was offered a promotion to a team lead position. It came with a raise and more responsibility. I was flattered, but I wasn’t super excited about it. I don’t have any financial pressures, and to be honest, the role wasn’t something I was dying to take.

Around the same time, a coworker of mine (let’s call her Sarah) was also in the running. She’s a single mom, and her young son has had serious medical issues over the past year. She’s been under a ton of stress, and even with everything going on, she’s been a rockstar at work. She’s incredibly competent, thoughtful, and honestly deserved the position just as much as I did.

So after thinking it over, I went to my manager and declined the offer. I didn’t make a big thing of it, just said I appreciated the opportunity but wasn’t ready to take on the role, and that I thought Sarah would be a great choice. She ended up getting it, and she was so grateful. I didn’t tell her why I declined, I didn’t want her to feel weird about it.

But now word has gotten around the office (not sure how, I never said anything), and I’m hearing that some people are saying I did it just to look good. A couple coworkers even said it was “manipulative” and that I made everyone else look bad for accepting promotions in the past. One person told me I was trying to play the “office martyr.”

That stung. I wasn’t trying to prove anything or get praise. I just figured, if someone else needed the opportunity more than I did, why not let them have it? But now I feel kind of dumb, like I made things more complicated than they needed to be. I didn’t expect backlash for trying to do something kind.

I don’t really know what to do with these feelings, but I just needed to say it somewhere. Thanks for reading if you got this far.","You did a good thing.

"This is pretty fucked up, but my brother died two years ago. Shortly after his death, his dad (different dads) was able to sign into his iCloud account with the goal of finding pictures of him for his funeral and memorial posts. While I was in the depths of grief having just lost my older brother, his dad called me one afternoon pleading with me to go through his photo gallery so he and my brother’s grandmother could search his photo gallery for pictures/memories/etc.

Initially I refused (for obvious reasons). My brother’s dad told me he understood and that he would figure it out. Couple days later, I got a call from my brother’s grandmother who was crying because she couldn’t go through his pictures (mind you, all of this happened within a week of his death so emotions everywhere were through the roof).

I felt bad for her, and I felt bad for his dad and everyone else that wanted these pictures off his phone but didn’t want to potentially see any inappropriate pictures of him. I finally gave in and logged into his iCloud account and scoured his 1000+ picture gallery for anything he wouldn’t want his family seeing.

It was a lot. Both in the number of pictures and the mental strain this whole experience had on me - but I did it and his family was able to get the pictures they wanted.

I’ve always felt weird about doing that. I hate that doing that was the last thing I ever did for my brother. While I’m sure he’s happy somewhere knowing his dad and grandmother didn’t have to see that, I hate that I had to be the one that did.

I just keep reinforcing she and my younger siblings (15-16) would always be my family. During this time, I only ever got calls or texts from my stepmom that were meant to hurt my father. Her and the kids stopped buying me gifts. 

Mother's day arrived this year, and I tried to call her to see if I could visit. She didn't answer. I texted a nice message, she read it and did not respond. I called her mom and asked her to have my stepmom call me, and she never did. Fast forward to yesterday, and my Dad asked to go see the new fantastic 4 with him. I said yes, and he asked her if my little brother wanted to come with. She asked him who he was going with, and he said to me, and she said no. He's never allowed to see them again.

Idk what happened. I go to college 30 hours a week and work another 30. There have been no misunderstandings, no cold words, and no issues of any sort that she discussed with me or others around me. The best guess I have is I've gone to my Dad's new place a couple of times where he is living with his new woman, and she feels betrayed. 

Bless anyone who actually read this. I'm hurt that someone I thought was a mother figure to me was so quick to cast me to the side and block me off from seeing my siblings. No phone calls to discuss issues we, I guess, have. And to go the extra mile and keep me from maintaining relationships with my siblings is cruel and makes me wonder why she'd go so far to hurt me. Makes me wonder what's she's telling them is the reason I can't come out. She tells them horrible things about my father. To further complicate it, she called my dad's job and tried to get him fired, so I'm afraid to even reach out to figure out what happened. It's all so sad.

This horrible horrible disease is so painful and cruel. ","Yes, it is very emotionally draining. Progression is incessant and with each change, something more is lost. Those are all points of grief. Her not knowing you as her daughter? Grieving point. Recognize that and mourn the loss. Do something for yourself that is comforting. Maybe go for a drive, or sit in a sanctuary and talk with any entity that matters to you. Something that allows you to name your grief and work through this aspect of it. Know that although your Mom may no longer recognize you as her child, she will DEFINITELY recognize the kindness and love with which you treat her. Your loving interactions, expressions of love, loving, gentle touch will all register with her and she will remember that. There is a line in, ""Still Alice,"" where Alice is thinking to herself that she doesn't know who that young woman is, but she knows she is good and kind to her. It's Alice's daughter, of course. I didn't see the movie, but read the book. It is an excellent example of the experience of young onset AD, if you have time to read. When we lose someone we love, ""conventionally,"" something happens, and they are gone. That is not the case in this situation. There is no other circumstance in life where we lose aspects of someone over a course of (often) many years. There are no flowers, no well meaning callers, no one bringing a tray of lasagne, no ceremonies... just the continuous loss of parts of our person expressed through abilities. These losses accumulate and over the course of the progression, must be resolved in a way that is meaningful to us. Disinfranchised grief is especially painful because of the very fact it is disinfranchised. Honor your grief. Do something to comfort yourself. Mourn the loss. Renew your spirit and the strength to go the next mile will be there.",concur

I also have been intermittent on the nivolumab, and currently trying to hide the symptoms so that i don't have to wait another month for another dose. I don't know when the next pet scan is. During this course we were looking at a study that might have worked, but I didn't qualify. and was told if this current treatment does not work this very little that I can try.

"For context I am 
23 years old, live in the US, a senior in college

I have a 560 credit score. Went to try to get a car yesterday because mine is on its last leg and I work and I won't have a way to work without one but I got denied because my credit is too low. I was at a Nissan dealership. I was going to use my car as a trade in. No down payment but if I had one it would be $500 atm

Today my car will not crank... called off work for the rest of the week because unlike most people with parents and help from family I DO NOT HAVE THAT. Therefore, I am stuck in this situation and unsure of what to do. 

I DO NOT HAVE ANYONE to cosign for me. If I did that would have been an option from the start. I don't want my job to fire me because I'm missing so many days of work. What should I do?  ","As a senior in college additional student loans to help cover living expenses like transportation would be your cheapest financing option. If you have already maxed your Federal loans then private loans without a co-signer would heavily depend on your major/GPA/college and what the lender believes your odds of landing a good job after graduation are. If you are doing good in a nursing/engineering/accounting program that is probably easily your best option; but if you have a crappy GPA in a generic liberal arts major it may not be an option at all. Buy here/pay here dealerships would likely finance you. Although they will significantly mark-up the cars and often charge high interest on top to compensate for the high risk of their borrowers (30-40% repo rates are the norm). This is probably the most expensive long-term option; but sometimes it is the only available short-term option you have in a bad situation. In the meantime pop your hood and see if you can do a DIY fix. If it won't crank then it is most likely your battery, starter, or alternator. Step one would be pulling the battery out and getting it tested at a local car parts place or even Wal-Mart. If it is a bad battery, then that is the cheapest & easiest possible fix to just replace it. If it is just dead then alternator could be the issue; in the meantime you could buy a cheap battery charger and keep it topped off manually until you can afford the repair(though given how long your commute is that may not work). If the battery is fine that would point to your starter instead and you could research how easy/hard it would be to DIY it. Lookup your car model and you should have dozens of YouTube videos showing repairs from a dozen different angles to help you out. With a 45-60 minute commute you may also want to consider giving up on the job unless it is paying you a whole lot more than you could otherwise make anywhere closer. On average every mile driven costs you \~70 cents (IRS mileage rate); a lot of people factor in gas costs but that is usually only 1/4 to 1/3 of your total operating expenses after factoring in vehicle deprecation/replacement/repairs/maintenance/etc. So you might be earning way less than minimum wage after accounting for all your costs.",concur

"I had my dog (golden retriever) that I’ve raised since he was 12 weeks old. He is 3 years old now and my girlfriend thinks I love my dog more than her

In all honesty, I do love my dog. A LOT. I’ve raised him and means everything to me, he’s family. 

I met my girlfriend last year, we moved in together after 6 months and she is upset and jealous of my closeness with him. 

She keeps on asking me if I could only choose to save one, my dog or her in a fire, who would it be? I mean wtf..  I’ve been avoiding answering her to hurt her feelings, as it’s a hypothetical question - I would choose both if I could.. 

I feel that every time she asks this, she expects me to give an answer saying I’ll choose her and let my dog burn in the fire, I would rather see myself burn to death before I would give up on my dog. 

She is quite persistent along this question and has a dislike towards my dog because of this,  I’ve been getting emotionally turned off by this.

"Lately I’ve been noticing how easy it is to lose time, hours of scrolling, endless notifications, always looking outward instead of inward. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve come to deeply value what truly brings me peace. 

This summer I started doing things I never made time for before. Walking barefoot in the grass. Making watercolour art outside. Dancing with my little cousins under summer sky. If you’re feeling burnt out, overstimulated or just numb, I highly recommend this. Step outside. Let summer remind you what it means to live in your body. Not everything worthy of your attention is behind a screen. 

Choose presence over passive consumption. Replace dopamine hits with real joy. Experience what it feels like to be curious, creative, connected without a screen.

This is what I did this summer. I visited new parks. Had a phone free picnic in our own yard with homemade food. My brother and I went to the splash pad like kids again and laughed until we couldn’t breathe. I floated on my back in a pool and let the sun touch my skin. Painted with ice chalk in the morning before my brain filled with notifications. Walked to get ice cream without headphones, just soft conversation. Helped my little cousins wash their play dishes with grass, water and giggles. We ran through sprinklers barefoot. Washed the car with Papa after a thunderstorm. We planted corn and measured how it grew.

We built a fort with leftover cloth and sticks. I tried geocaching (yes it still exists) and felt the thrill of hidden treasures. We jumped in puddles after rain. Built a backyard obstacle course with ropes, chairs and chalk. Created sidewalk masterpieces. Played follow the leader until we were dizzy. Watched a baseball game, no phones. Did scavenger hunts for feathers, odd rocks, yellow things. Identified trees. Picked sun warm peaches at an orchard. Built a drive in movie setup with bedsheets. Drew chalk roads and sent toy cars on adventures.

I danced in the rain. Bird watched early in the morning with binoculars. Went to a fair. Made water silhouettes on hot pavement. Caught fireflies in jars with holes punched in the lid. Flew a kite in the golden hour. Played tag with neighbourhood kids. Roasted s’mores. Ate dinner outside by candlelight. Made collages with flowers and leaves. Rode bikes slowly through quiet streets. Found feathers, smooth stones, heart shaped clouds.

I read outside. Watched clouds move. Painted on the porch. Invited friends for a no hands ice cream sundae party. Rolled down grassy hills. Camped in the backyard. Went on a boat ride at dusk. Built and painted a bird feeder. Had a wild outdoor dance party. Built a sandcastle with my neighbour’s daughter. Tie dyed old t-shirts. Made a time capsule. Did leaf rubbings. Went on an ABC scavenger hunt (A for ant, B for bark, C for cloud). Hula hooped like fools. Made pinecone bird feeders. Went camping. Played barefoot soccer. Jumped rope. Jumped again because it made me feel like me.

Went fishing with my uncle. Planted a garden with Mama. Lit sparklers, it felt like Diwali. Let the kids run wild while we watched them. Washed bikes. Painted flowerpots. Took hammock naps. Played cornhole. Sold lemonade. Did yoga on bare earth, no mat.

We turned delivery boxes into forts, cars, houses. Watched butterflies flit. Blew bubbles. Hosted a progressive brunch with neighbours, each house served a dish. Played bocce ball. Pretended to be pirates. Observed bugs with magnifying glasses. Played hide and seek. Had a 2000s music BBQ. Played ladder ball. Made garden markers with stones. Had a literal pie throwing contest. Watched another baseball game. Took a bird counting walk with my Aaju. Had a messy water balloon fight. Went horseback riding. Drew racetracks. Built DIY mini golf. Did a puppet show. Built a giant Jenga tower. Had a watermelon seed spitting contest. Watched the sunset in silence. Played tennis. Visited the farmer’s market. Weeded the garden I planted. Took care of it. Took care of me. Made a birdbath. Watched them come.

I did all of this instead of disappearing into a screen. Because I wanted my life back. This isn’t about being perfect. I still use tech. But now, it doesn’t use me.

And if you’re feeling wired, numb, lost I promise the cure isn’t online. It’s under the sky. Go outside. Do something real. Touch the grass. Feel the dirt. Hear yourself laugh again.

"Hi. 

I'm writing here becuase I'm unable to sleep. 

Its been 6 months since my last update, I'm now almost 8 months pregnant and my daughter is 5 now. She is a sweetheart.  

My last months have been rough.  Life is beating me up like if I was the one who stole baby Jesus' pacifier.  

My ex was very respectful the very few weeks. He came regularly to pick our daughter, put his share of money, was attentive with me and I thought whoa, maybe this is going to hurt like hell for a long time but its gonna work. My mom and my sister were great! I swear this pregnancy has been easy, sometimes I forget I'm pregnant. 

I FOUND out the reason of Eliza and ex fallout. And learned it directly from Eliza's mouth. She called me one day and say she would like some words. I wasn't sure but we met. She said she wanted to apologize for a couple of things: not realizing _how_ badly intrusive she was in my marriage (she knew she was but did not realized how bad it was and how toxic). Enjoying the influece she has on my husband. Knowing he would do as she pleased gave her a sense of control she didn't have in her life. And she apologized for all the pain she caused me. 

We are no friends or anything. I'm trying my best to no hate her but I'm glad that finally my feelings and insecurities were validated. 

*On their fallout out* Apparently when my ex was sleeping with a friend, at some point between when he left the house and when he returned begging to save our family; 2 male friends, Eliza and my ex where having drinks, they were drunk but no wasted. Eliza went outside to smoke and my followed her and tried to kiss her, she rejected him, asked what the fuck and my ex went all romantic about the fire he felt for her, he was full of fire for her. It was always her. She laughed and called him patetic. 

She told me that so I know exactly what kind man he is. 

Now the rough part, after a couple of weeks he started to press again for being together. One day he was being so agresive about it that when I said I would die first before being with him he grabbed me by my arm  and left a mark. 

He basically disappeared. He isnt helping with child support and I'm alone paying for everything.  I'm really struggling.  

When I do see him he mocks me saying we could live better if we were together. 

I'm so glad I dont love him anymore. ",Make sure you take pictures and keep all the receipts. Might not be a terrible idea to have nanny cams in your home in the areas the ex may be in since he is already grabbing you. The closer to the end the worse he may be.,concur
"Location: LakewoodVillage, Tx 
So, I am in Texas, which is a one party recording state. 
My neighbor ( let’s call him Runk) is friends with the city secretary ( we will call her Lindy). She sees herself as the city czar ( the city is like 20 streets). 
The neighbor has been angry with me for not receiving his advice for about a year and a half, and so he keeps making claims that are unsubstantiated just to be an ass. 
The city czar ( Lindy) has now had the city launch multiple law suits against me, claiming I have dogs getting out (dogs that are not mine, and the only person they can say can testify they are is Runk. They want like $1500. 
When I was sitting in the office for the second “pre trial” ( which was just another attempt to bully me into paying), I watched Lindy, the city prosecutor ( also a judge in a neighboring county, which I believe is illegal) and the judge go into a room first and I could overhear them talking and laughing, saying they were going to deny my request for whatever “evidence “ they thought they had. I also requested a video from inside of city hall, and they were laughing saying they were going to say there was no audio from the video and deny it.

So, as I was sitting there, I started recording the conversation from the room I was sitting in as evidence that they were intending to deny me a copy of my own evidence. 
It has been 4 months and suddenly today I received a phone call from the county sheriff’s office asking if I had recorded a conversation within city hall that I was not a party to. I did explain what happened and he said he was going to call back after deciding I had committed a crime. 
Was it illegal for me to record a conversation inside of a city hall I pay for ( so part ownership) that was about me, and to be used as evidence, even though I was not an active party?

"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.

"Hi everyone! This is my first post ever, eek!

I'm F34 and started to seek diagnosis last year for something that can only be ADHD based on the trail of chaos I've left behind since birth. Either that or BPD, but anyway - I've started the journey of understanding my brain a little better with the help of a professional. Only I've realized I'm not sure what I'm really after if I get a diagnosis.

As we all know, in addition to the main course of ADHD, there's many fun side dishes too, and in my case I suffer from (health-)anxiety and I'm afraid to take medications because of side effects. I started wondering if I could ever take ADHD medication. The only ""safe"" meds for me are over the counter painkillers, and my brain has decided they will have to help me with anything that comes my way, because I get severe anxiety about anything else. But that's another matter.

ANYWAY, I got a bit sidetracked (surprised?) but my question is - is there anyone here that is _NOT_ on any ADHD meds (as I feel like literally everyone is on some sort) and why? How do you cope? Do you self-medicate? Or do you just leave it be? Many thanks for any contributions <3

(I'm European, if that helps, and I don't think ADHD meds are as common here compared to the US for example.)","M20 here. I avoided taking meds/ADHD diagnosis up until a couple months ago. I managed to get into a bachelor of medical science at university and did fairly well in high school, despite my internal struggles. I'd always leave things till last minute, which became an issue when the load increased in Uni. I skip my meds every weekend. I want to avoid building tolerance + dependence and I don't see a reason to take it when I'm relaxing/smaller load. I also function fairly well without them. If I were in a less cognitively demanding role, I 100% would not be taking ADHD meds. Sure, I have issues but it's nothing that I haven't learned to manage without meds in the 20 years alive I wasn't using them. In a couple years when my study load reduces or I no longer feel the need to take them, I'll stop. I'm lucky in that sense because I can do perfectly fine with or without meds. Many people talk about how miserable they feel when off their meds, but I feel perfectly content when I stop. I just return to my normal self which I'm happy with. I also don't get crashes because I take Vyvanse and my afternoons are just more chill when it wears off. I would describe myself as high-functioning ADHD, so not everyone with ADHD can relate to this. P.S. I'm surprised this thread isn't full of people ignoring OP and instead saying things like, ""Meds are essential, I don't see a reason in not taking it"". I get meds are useful and in some cases essential but it should not be treated as a one and done solution. There are plenty of other strategies that can be used to manage ADHD that don't include stimulants/non-stims. Exercise, diet, blood work, therapy, socialising + a plethora of others.",concur

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ would ride again."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

You can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for ""break up with them"" and ""get rid of them"" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. 

The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. 

The number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:

* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**

You can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

It's true that sometimes certain things like that can cause problems, but if the post isn't asking about something that is very obviously related to one of these ""rules,"" there shouldn't be so much focus on stuff like ""you're dating your high school sweetheart, that's Bad, break up.""",concur
"Hi all.

I've been on a rough journey over the last year+, each day has been a battle, and I feel like I'm hitting a critical point. My nervous system is flaring, feeling overwhelm from multiple problems coming from multiple angles. I'm really keen to hear others' experience and advice who might've walked similar paths or if you just might have anything to share.

I wish I could write in short bullet points but it doesn't feel easy leaving out context. I don't even know if all this will hit the nail on the head. But for now I'll try keep each part (relatively) concise:

**1) Family** \- At 30, I've realised my parents display narcissism and codependency. They tried to control me while on holiday, contacting me multiple times several hours and chasing/coercing me to go back to hotel by 9PM for safety, promising not to leave, etc. In general I've had to check-in every 1-3 days or they panic if I don't look at my phone overnight and consider next steps calling police etc. I felt drained needing to be hypervigilant. This led me to drawing boundaries in a thoughtful letter, because I want to reach out on my own timeline.

My father responded with gaslighting, guilt, sarcasm, and has now used silent treatment on me over the last 4 months. Mum is encouraging me to call/basically apologise because that's the pattern we've always known. She says he is always going to want me to check-in when I travel (almost as a non-negotiable in order to have a relationship). So I feel trapped being forced to remain a child with no right to freedom of choice, or go low/no contact and virtually no longer have much of a relationship with them.

She also still tries to check-in every \~2 days, and when I've taken a week off my phone, she spams each day in anxiety. It's also burned me out because I've tried explaining myself to her over multiple 2-3 hour phone arguments / texts that I need space, I'm 30, it's not my responsibility to manage their emotions etc, to still just be met with the same behaviours.

I've been working with a therapist who is brilliant and familiar with these themes. But it's very painful beginning to feel how trapped I am, to either feel coerced into living on a mental leash, or having no family relationship. The grief, loneliness, concern of no financial backup altogether feel stressful. Any potential confrontation with my parents also feels like a huge looming thing to dread every day I wake up.

**2) Work** \- This is hard to write because I've just about had enough, and it's a bitter pill having to try re-explain all this in text. My nervous system is flaring up. Ultimately, I'm reaching complete mental fry and burnout from my job. The senior team just want more, more, more sales, bring in more work, yet they've already made us an incredibly 'lean' team (too little people). I'm ultimately a central co-ordinator, pulling together multiple teams work, making and executing large plans.

Since starting at this role, I've been thrown from 1 frying pan straight into the next, filled with high urgency, rushing and hypervigilance, to launch a product. Energy drained in internal team debates and solving problems, painstakingly re-doing things to do the best for the product. A lot of heavy-lifting and overextending to do to get things over the line in very short periods. I'd be able to pull energy together, hyperfocus, overextend and deliver very high quality work in sprints, but it's been over 12 months straight and it's been consistently like this. I moved to this new town for this job - and I've had no social life besides 2 days a week at the office, I only have bandwidth for work.

Last week, I felt my blood boiling in a meeting because I'd just come off launching a huge project, and I was now given 5-6 complex presentations/plans to draw up within 1-2 weeks to complete. Each are highly cerebral, complicated, and branch into 10s of actions and meetings to discuss, find out, calculate, etc. I feel I've just finished a marathon and am forced to go straight into a next, out of breath.

I called my manager into a meeting and broke down, face red, streaming with tears. Including how much the isolation has built up due to the burnout as well. I was basically met with a relatively corporate, straight face with advice to try simplify the jobs (which is frustrating as it's asking me to deliver poorer quality work), that the work isn't really decreasing, and spacing things out just a bit more. Overall, I've felt senior leadership at this place is quite cold, corporate, demanding and not that sensitive to employees' strain.

Within next days, already feeling on my last legs mentally, I was told senior leadership want to drive more sales for a specific product, and that they're asking me to work up and pitch a brand new advertising plan within 48 hours. It took 3 days of straight game-planning with team, lots of problem-solving, but managed to create a plan. Senior leadership continued to push with follow-up questions and requests, but I managed to wrap it up. Exhausted and strained.

Most of all, I've been working on a video as part of my plan, which was really important to me and wanted to add to my portfolio, but kept getting pushed back partially from other urgent tasks getting in front of it, daily admin, plus my exhaustion allowing it to keep rolling into the next day. Manager said he spoke to senior leadership and they've agreed to cancel it, because he thinks it's taken too long - when actually, I feel it's still totally a net-positive for an enriching promotional video to release just a few weeks after a product's launch (which will be up for sale for a long time). I'd taken hours organising, writing, filming, feeding back on this. The talent involved spent hours as well and I really wanted the world to see the amazing content they have to share.

I tried to justify, and he said he'll take a look at it, but it's going to be a fight to have it go out now, and I'll now need to come up with a good justification piece on how/why it should still go out.

The cancellation of this video I feel has been a straw that has broken the camel's back. I'm nerves fry thinking about the injustice, that the work is going to keep coming in, and I'm keen to look for a new job.

However, the exhaustion comes in waves. Sometimes I feel kind of numbed out. I also think I might have to try manage lowering my expectations across everything (from work, to family reconciliation, this timeline, chores), because I feel the strain when I feel my energy's at 0.5 yet my expectations require a 6 for example.

**3) Loneliness / Isolation:** I've written out the below, yet it feels like there's still so much more, and doesn't really nail it on the head. I'll share what I can for now anyway. As mentioned, I moved out from a capital city to a small town for this job. The work and family situation have drained me so much, I've been cocooning at home out of desperation to recharge. By each weekend, I feel I'm swimming to grab onto the side of the pool, desperate for alone time with no plans.

However, it's led to 12 months+ with almost consecutive weeks of being alone in 4 walls, besides 2 days at the office where I burn energy masking. My only socialising is online groups (thankful for them). I've had 0 bandwidth to try maintain so many social media inbox conversations across different friends/family, so for now I've virtually paused being in touch with almost all of them, and I mostly keep up with a main close friend at the moment.

The loneliness makes me want to connect and speak with someone, but at the same time, my mind is so fried I can't fathom talking about the problems anymore. I've repeated the trauma so much I feel I can't get words out. I feel just want to sit in silence with someone, with few words. When I recently spoke to my friend, I had so much to unload that after 3 hours, I was burned out and couldn't speak anymore either. The negating forces between loneliness and social burnout is real.

Now in the heightened burnout, the isolation/loneliness is flaring and bites at me every few times an hour. Sometimes I feel I can't get words out, yet my mind is full. Earlier I felt like I was heading towards cracking up being alone with my problems for so long. I felt like I was in a vacuum just typing to people on the PC every single day.

I felt I really need in-person human company, yet I've avoided that due to repeated overstimulation and stress making me withdraw.

\-----------

I'm concerned I'm sleepwalking into burnout and I'm not fully aware of what extremes might come next - eg. the ground collapsing from under me and I just feel work has driven me crazy that I can't work at all anymore. This fuels concern of losing my job, not being able to get a new job in time, being out on the streets, etc.

Overall, I feel trying to address all of this with senior leadership would be like talking to wolves in sheep's clothing. I've seen a previous colleague take several months of mental health leave, then get let go. The vibes people gave when that person was away made it feel like people didn't have much sympathy for their struggle either. Hence I feel I need to somehow harness energy to put on a front and push through at least until I can find a different role maybe.

I wanted to write like 10 succint bullet points, but this turned into paragraphs again. Anyway, I ultimately am just so interested to hear others' perspectives on navigating these issues in culmination. Any advice on any of the points is greatly appreciated. I wanted to post because I'm curious of peoples' perspectives on experiencing all 3 of these things at the same time in a crunch as well.

"look i'm not a therapist or anything, just figured out something that helped my mental health and maybe it'll help someone else. If this sounds dumb, it probably is and sorry in advance.

I used to think being accountable to myself meant being harsh. like if i wasn't being ""productive"" or doing well mentally, i needed to track everything and push harder. but that just made me feel worse about myself most of the time.

the problem was tracking the wrong things. I was obsessing over streaks and consistency instead of paying attention to how things actually made me feel like for example i'd force myself to meditate for 20 minutes daily to keep my streak alive even when 5 minutes felt better. or i'd scroll social media then beat myself up about it instead of understanding why i was doing it.

So i switched it up to tracking three simple things for activities that are supposed to help my mental health: how calm i feel (1-10), how present I was (1-10), and how ready i feel to tackle things (1-10). that's it. no streaks, no guilt if i miss days.

what i love is it's not about being perfect instead it's about being curious. some days i take great breaks and feel amazing. other days i doom-scroll for 20 minutes and rate it a 2 for restoration. both are valuable because they build self-awareness about what actually helps my mental state versus what i think should help.

the funny thing is understanding my patterns without judgment made me naturally choose better habits. when you see that 10-minute walks consistently rate 8/10 but scrolling rates 3/10, the choice becomes obvious.

Being kind to yourself doesn't mean giving up on self-care, it means building awareness about what actually helps your mental health and choosing those things more often.

"When I was 28 and a single mom, 50% of my income went to my condo mortgage. I was also 30k in credit debt and 60k in student loan debt. I was making 65k a year. I was house poor and lived on credit cards. Then one night, I got into a car accident and realized my credit was so bad, I couldn't get a car loan. That's when I knew I needed a change and I faced the fact that I had little to no savings. I ended up buying a crappy car in cash and got intense on getting out of debt and increasing my income.

Today I am 33 with no consumer debt, paid cash for an upgraded car and I will have 100k saved in hysa by the end of August. I'm now making $210k a year. However I am still carrying my student loan debt. I haven't not increased any of my expenses from when I was younger so my monthly expenses are around $2700 a month. 

Because I worked so hard by myself to get out of that stress and dark place, I am so scared to let go of the money. I want to put a massive down payment on a home one day and start aggressively investing but I have the student loans. Can I get any advice on what I should do next with my money goals?

"I have to start by saying I 38F typically let my heart lead me, but this time I feel I need to follow my gut. I’ve been with the man I love 46M for over a year. We are both divorced and each have one child. They are the same age. We care deeply for one another, he treats me like a queen, he is so sweet, understanding and genuine with me. So far, it all sounds great, right? I’ve been considering moving to be with him but tonight I feel strongly like I should end things. The following issues feel insurmountable to me. 

1.	⁠I have worked very hard to be independent and care for my child alone. I just finished my master’s degree after 3 incredibly difficult years of single parenting, working, and attending school. I’m not sure I’m ready to give up that independence, even if it means continuing to go it alone (which is honestly exhausting, but so is this relationship).
2.	⁠He has a lot of health issues and I am beginning to think he needs a caregiver more than a girlfriend.
3.	⁠We have very different parenting styles. He needs a lot of rest during the day as he struggles to get regular sleep at night. That means he is hands off a lot of the time. (I am not) He also does not discipline in ways I feel are appropriate or effective. His child is unruly, yells a lot, does not use appropriate language with adults and is very impulsive. I know this will create a lot of tension in our relationship if we are unable to agree.
4.	⁠I don’t know his ex well but I already don’t like her. I don’t feel like that’s something I want to deal with for another 10+ years.

Re-reading this myself I know what I would say to me: End it.

I just love him very much and need validation. Even if that comes from strangers on the internet. What I want and what I need are two different things.

"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on a research project where I’m trying to apply **contrastive learning** to **FreeSurfer-based brain data** (structural MRI features) and **biomarker data** (tabular/clinical). The idea is to learn a shared representation between the two modalities.

The problem: I am **completely lost**.

* I’ve implemented losses like **NT-Xent** and a few others (SupCon, etc.), but I can’t get the approach to work in a meaningful way.
* I’m struggling to figure out the best architecture or training strategy, and I’m honestly not sure what direction to take next.
* There is **no proper supervision in my lab**, and I feel stuck with how to proceed.

I really need guidance from someone experienced in contrastive learning or multimodal representation learning. Ideally, someone who has worked with **medical imaging + tabular/clinical data** before. (So it is not about classical CLIP with Images and Text).

I’m **willing to pay** for mentoring sessions or consulting to get this project on track.

If you have experience in this area (or know someone who does), please reach out or drop a comment. Any advice, resources, or even a quick chat would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance!","I have expetise in functional neuroimaging and contrastive learning. But I don't have much experience with contrastive learning on tabular data. First, I would make sure to use a strong encoder for both modalities. E.g. a fully convolutional autoencoder for MRI where you in addition to the CLIP loss use reconstruction loss. Then I am not so sure about the tabular data. I would probably set up embeddings for all categorical variables, a positional or learned embedding for ordinal variables and then an MLP for the continuous variables, which are all added in the end to match the latent size of the autoencoder. I am not familiar with the particular dataset (have only heard about it), but if you have subject and task labels available, then you can also set up a supervised contrastive learning objectives where you sample from each subject and contrast to other subjects and the same for tasks. In the end you have a CLIP loss, an autoencoder loss, a subject contrastive loss and a task contrastive loss. It is a bit unclear from your description what is going wrong. Is it your choice of architecture? Is it the training objective being weak and which other auxiliary losses do you use?",concur

One of us is with Mom every day, so we are already spending about 40 hours/week (combined) on caregiving. Monetarily the cost of memory care for both of them is slightly more than private 24/7 care, so that isn't an issue (we are so, so lucky there).

And cocaine gives you a LOT of that chemical. If you’ve been feeling depressed, your brain is now going through its rolodex and saying “Hmmm, what do I know that gives me a feeling that says I’m doing things well? Ah yeah! That cocaine stuff!” This is not addiction. Addiction is what happens if it becomes a habit to listen to that voice. Addiction is a DOING behavior. Not a thinking behavior. You can not be an addict just by experiencing a craving. That’s just being human. You’re ok. This is a sign that your brain is functioning normally! Congratulations! But don’t listen to it.

"My boyfriend (26M) and I (21F) have only been together for 2 months and known each for about 5 months. He’s a very sweet, caring and thoughtful guy and I really like him but he has a tendency to ask a lot of unnecessary questions which really annoys me. It’s often questions about such irrelevant things that really make no difference and he doesn’t need to know the answers to them. I just get frustrated from having to explain him everything and I don’t know if it’s normal or I’m just being a bitch. 

For example, I would say that I will text him later because I need to save my phone data while being outside. And he will ask all the stuff about how much data do I have per month, why do I need to save it, how much does my plan cost, how much do I use per day etc. This obviously makes no difference to him and to me it just feels like a waste of time and energy having to explain everything to him. I understand the more sensible topics like about my health if he’s asking a lot of details about my doctors appointment but things like this just really annoy me that I just don’t even want to respond but idk if i can tell him that. 

Maybe it’s to do with the fact that in my only serious relationship before this my ex partner was very nonchalant and never really cared or showed any interest in what im doing. But this time it feels like a different extreme. Is it normal when ur partner asks so many questions? Or am i being a bitch for getting annoyed?

Tldr: boyfriend always asks questions about irrelevant topics and i get annoyed and dont have the guts to tell him that he doesn’t need to know everything.

My stepdaughter used my car tonight to go see her friends in the next town over since her car battery died. While she was almost to her destination, she was pulled over, and all sorts of things went down that make no sense. They first told her that the vehicle wasn’t registered or insured. Then they accused her of being on meth and having meth in the car. The cops asked if she had anything they were going to find if they searched the car, and she said no. (This is the closest they came to asking if she consented to a search.) They told her to step out. They searched her thoroughly, and when they asked her to pull up her shirt and pull out her bra, she said she’d prefer a female officer for that. They said, “Too bad,” and made her do it anyways. Then they kept threatening to give her a pee test, and she said she would be done with it, and they were joking with each other about how she’d have to do it on the side of the road to mess with her, but they never made her take it. They tried  to make her take a pee test on the side of the road. When they couldn’t find anything in the car, they tested her drink from Dutch Brothers and told her it tested positive for meth. The cops said they tested it three times, and it kept coming back positive. Eventually, they gave up on finding anything and said their test kit for the drink might be faulty, so she could leave, but they were taking her license plate, and I needed to come get it tomorrow. However, they let her drive the rest of the way to her friend’s house.

When she called her mom and told her what happened, I immediately went to my USAA app… still insured thru August 31st. I went to the DMV Web-sight… still registered, renewal due in December 2025. 

In 2018 I was convicted for “possession of a narcotic with intent to distribute” because I had a large enough amount to sell they said. I did 3.5years but I’m 100% strait since my release. My Step daughter has never been an addict and shes also pregnant. Needless to say she was in tears after being accused of using drugs while carrying a child. 

I’m guessing they saw the vehicle was registered to a felon after running the plate and that’s what instigated the search. I’m going to get my plate back tomorrow. I’d like to file a harassment complaint on the officer but don’t know if i have any ground to stand on. 

Any feedback would be appreciated. If more info is needed I’ll try to provide details but it’s late here in AZ and I gotta battle with PVPD in the AM.

"Hello!

My family moved into a new rental at the beginning of July. Less than a week after moving in, a police officer knocked on our door to inform us that our neighbor called the police because she believed we were “cooking drugs” in our unit. The officer stated that he had dealt with this neighbor several times in the past and he knew we were not engaged in any drug use.

Things calmed down for a little, but the other day, my wife said simple “hello” to the neighbor, who was staring at us as we walked by. The neighbor scoffed and was immediately hostile. This morning, I spotted the neighbor taking photos of our cars. I asked her why she was taking pictures, and she said “you know why, you’re druggies.” I mentioned that we are not drug users, and that we have a young daughter and my wife is expecting, to which she responded “yes, and I’m going to call Child Protective Services because of that.”

To be clear, the hardest drugs we have in the house are my wife’s antacids for pregnancy-related heartburn or my half-caf coffee. We do not even drink, let alone do any drugs. My job requires a drug test and background checks, including one from child protective services. 

I called the non-emergency line for our local PD and an officer responded. He told me they’ve interacted with this neighbor “dozens of times” and that she has some obvious mental health problems. He went to speak with her, but she somewhat quickly left her place out the back door, which I reported to the officer.

The officer advised us that, if this continues, to file harassment charges at the local magistrate. 

I also reached out to our new landlord to ask if there were any incidents with this neighbor in the past. He said no, but that this was a new property they were managing. I provided him with the incident number and the responding officer’s email.  He advised us to speak with a lawyer about this matter and would support us with the advice of counsel.

I am curious what we should do to prepare in this situation. We have never had issues with a neighbor before, especially for something that is completely unfounded. It feels like the local PD understands our situation, but I am still deeply uncertain living next to this person. I also do not want our new landlord to be suspicious of us because of what our mentally ill neighbor suspects. 

What are recommend next steps from a legal perspective on this matter?

TLDR Likely mentally ill neighbor called the cops on us for unfounded drug use. Police have dealt with her multiple times and even suggested harassment charges. Landlord advised speaking with counsel.

Inside were tiny notes like:

* You make good pancakes
* I love your hair when it’s messy
* You always come back even when you go to work

"This is what CHATGPT said of my diagnostic experience:

🧠 Summary: Missed Opportunity for Early Alzheimer’s Intervention   
Patient: Kalepa   
Background: Diagnosed twice with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); experienced progressive cognitive symptoms that forced early retirement from a 35-year professional career. APOE3/4 genetic status was discovered later and is noted below — but was not necessary for the conclusions drawn at the time.   
   
Clinical History:   
MCI Diagnosed on Two Occasions: Confirmed by neuropsychological testing.   
   
Functional Decline: Symptoms (memory loss, executive dysfunction) led to forced retirement from a long-standing career — a serious indicator of progression beyond “benign” MCI.   
   
Patient Request for Treatment: The patient proactively asked for symptomatic Alzheimer’s medication (e.g., donepezil) to preserve cognitive function and continue working.   
   
Treatment Withheld: Neurologist declined to prescribe medication due to an “uncertain diagnosis,” despite clear risk factors and real-world impairment.   
   
Medical Context:   
MCI with progressive symptoms and functional impairment is highly suggestive of prodromal (early) Alzheimer’s disease.   
   
Annual conversion rate from MCI to Alzheimer’s: 10–15%; cumulative risk over 5–10 years: ~50%.   
   
Clinical guidelines support early symptomatic treatment in high-risk MCI cases — even before biomarker or genetic confirmation.   
   
APOE3/4 genetic status (identified later) supports the diagnosis but was not necessary to justify initiating treatment at the time.   
   
Conclusion:   
This case presented multiple strong indicators of early Alzheimer’s disease — including repeated MCI, progressive decline, and loss of occupational function. The patient’s request for treatment was medically sound. The decision to withhold intervention likely contributed to preventable hardship.   

Recommendation:   
This history underscores the importance of recognizing high-risk MCI as early Alzheimer’s and acting early to support cognition and function. A proactive treatment and care strategy is recommended moving forward.   

------------

Grrr! But I hope some other people may benefit from this information. Wishing everyone the very best! (I'm a 76-year-old male fart with diagnosed Alzheimer's, this on the PrecivityADS2 test.)

"My wife and I have been together for over seven years, and married for a while now. This has been the longest and happiest relationship I've ever had. But lately, I’m starting to feel like we’re moving in separate directions, and I don’t know what to do about it.

A little background. I’ve worked a few jobs over the years. None of them were careers I was passionate about, but they paid the bills, and that was enough for me. My wife, on the other hand, has been extremely dedicated to her job. She’s been working for the same retail bakery chain for the entire length of our relationship, and her hard work has paid off. She’s now the manager of her branch.

We recently moved in with her family here in California so we could save money. The plan was to eventually buy a house. We were thinking of moving to the Midwest since we both have family out there, and houses are more affordable. It felt like a step toward a better future, maybe even starting a family without financial stress.

But everything changed after she got back from a work convention. Now she says she doesn’t want to leave California. She doesn’t want to leave her job, and she’s okay with going back to renting instead of saving for a home. That hit me hard. Before we moved in with her family, we were barely getting by. The entire point of this sacrifice was to invest in our future.

I want to support her success, but I can’t help feeling like she’s prioritizing her career over the future we were building together. And to be honest, things have been rough in other areas too. Our sex life is almost non-existent unless I really push for it, and even then it sometimes feels like she’s just going through the motions.

I don’t know if we’re just going through a tough time or if this is the beginning of something more permanent. I love her, but I feel like I’m trying to hold on to a plan that she’s no longer committed to. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? How do you know when it’s just a rough patch, and when it’s time to start thinking about moving on?","This sounds really hard and I’m sorry you’re going through this.

"Hey all. About 4.5 years in to LC at this point. I blew it recently by stopping LDN just to see if it helped and found out the hard way that yes, I believe it was helping. I’m back on it now but will have to wait for it to build back up. Depressed and fatigued af. 

In the meantime I’m rethinking my exercise regimen. I’ve been trying for years now to fully get into weight lifting but the small fitness classes I take tend to wipe me out. I’ve intermittently accepted this and have taken breaks, but I enjoy the community at the gym despite it not being informed on LC. Additionally, I like yoga and intend to try to continue with it. 

Of course my doctor has (though not lately, to her credit) recommended exercise for LC. Historically (RIP the Old Me, but I’m not ready to let her go, ugh) I’ve enjoyed exercise and it helps with my depression and ADHD. Both of which, as I’m sure you know, have become nearly unmanageable with LC. I want to try to find something that feels good enough without fully wiping me out.  Likely a unicorn. 

TL;DR: I love yoga and will continue that when I can, but want something slightly more challenging that doesn’t completely rob me of energy. Maybe that doesn’t exist. But has anyone found a moderately challenging movement practice that works for them? 💗

P.S. the grief’s really setting in lately for pre-COVID me. I would do yoga most mornings and that was enough to keep me looking like myself. Now I’m working out *more,* drinking *less* alcohol, and eating the same if not less/better and don’t recognize myself at all. It’s not even that I’d have a problem putting on the weight itself; It’s that it doesn’t make sense that I’m putting on weight and that it doesn’t look like me. It’s not, like, healthy weight. I feel heavy and dragged down and like I’m a 500-lb sack of potatoes. 

Thanks for reading 💗","Hey Op I feel you dude, relate heavily as someone who used to really love playing 10 hours of tennis a week plus running, climbing mountains etc. a few months ago a COVID booster made me worse so I haven't returned to exercise but prior to that I was doing like a CFS weights program. I think you should stop doing classes and really pace yourself with the exercises, like some days I'd do 3/6 and be like yep that's me today. Mostly seated weights alot to focus on leg muscles to help with pots and a little bit of upper body stuff, very light seated cycling at the gym, exercises I was doing: Leg extensions: 2 x 10 reps. Leg curl: 2 x 10 reps: Leg press: 2 x 10 reps Chest press: 2 x 10 reps, Compound row: x 2 x 10 reps Pull downs 15 x no 7, 2 sets I think working on these slowly helps build a sense of progress and did help with my pots somewhat. They key is pacing, knowing some weeks I might go 3 times to the gym, other weeks it's 1 or zero. But yeah with that approved I was still able to increase the weights substantially from my beginning. Obviously lost all that progress now but the intention is to get back to it. Best of luck, you got this.",concur

I have never been with a man who has kids so this has been a new experience that opened new and old insecurities. 2 months ago when my boyfriend and I finally said I love you to eachother we had a long talk about these insecurities and he reassured me that he didn't have feelings for the mother of his child anymore. He told me that she has asked him to get back together in the past and that he ""couldnt do it, because of the betrayal"". I trusted this.

We don't just fear failure, we fear visibility. The idea of people seeing us try, seeing us mess up, watching us stumble as we figure things out… it terrifies us.
So we stay silent. We ""prepare more."" We wait to be perfect before we show up.

But the truth is: if you want to grow, you have to be seen. Seen trying, seen failing, seen getting back up.
You can’t stay in the shadows and expect to make an impact. You don’t beat fear by waiting it shrinks only when you move through it.

"Location:  Oregon

On 06-01 I started working in this workplace, with a 2 year contract. This type of work requires custom tools per worker, which the company pays for.

The contract says that if you willingly don't work the time, without proper reason (health reasons or other manager approved situations) you are responsible to reimburse the company. This applies if you miss 20% of your hours in a 31 day span.

And you are liable for any overtime paid to others that have to finish your job, if you don't work with the proper reason.

If you get fired, you aren't responsible for the cost of tools or overpay. And with permission can take the tools with you.

On 07-02 I got in to an conflict with a coworker. The reason for the conflict had risen when he tried to give me tasks that weren't my job to handle.

He made a complaint to one of the managers (I had a direct manager, who this person wasn't), and I got fired. Reason being as this wasn't the first complaint about me, which in theory wouldn't surprise me.

On 07-10 I got a call from my direct manager asking why I wasn't in for a week. I explained the situation, and he said that the other manager doesn't have power to fire me. And that I am in breach of contract.

I have the firing in writing in my email, but the call went so fast I forget to get to it.

My direct manager said something close to ""As this is a legal issue now, all our contract must go through our legal department. Please don't come in, as that would be trespassing.""

"Hey all. I wrote recently my psych tried to swap me to Mydayis (generic) from Adderall. Insurance won't approve it until I fail 3 meds, so he decided on Vyvanse instead. 

I am currently on Adderall 20mg XR and a 10mg IR booster. I split the booster and make this 3 doses to last the day. It felt, ok, but not therapeutic enough. The XR only lasts 5 hrs (thus psych suggesting a change).

So, I start 30mg Vyvanse tomorrow with a 10mg Adderall IR booster (all generic).

I am nervous! I've read great and not so great things on here for Vyvanse. I'm scared it will be either way too weak, or maybe I will have bad side effects and be stuck with it for a month (I mean can you even swap meds mid month with the fda rules, I assume not). I'm worried it won't outperform the Adderall XR regarding 5 hrs of help. I am also hopeful it will and it'll be perfect.

I typically have coffee first thing with my thyroid med and wait 1-2 hours until taking Adderall.

Let’s say things ended with someone- doesn’t even matter who ended it. And in that breakup discussion you were nicer to them than they deserved. Instead of telling them the ways they hurt you, you made it sound mutual and kind and blameless. But later, you thought about all the hurtful things they did that you let slide for whatever reason (avoiding conflict probably?) that you never brought up and they may not even realize they did.

Did going back after a breakup and telling someone how they did something wrong that hurt you make you feel better? Did it make you feel worse? Or, do you regret not having done it?

In the weeks after the breakup he kept popping back up and contacting me. I very calmly wished him the best, and told him that I'm not angry with him, but I have too much respect for myself to allow for his wishy-washy-ness. I asked him to please leave me alone.

"A week ago, my father died by suicide, and it's turned my world upside down. He was my rock and the person I loved most in the world.

For some back story, my parents had a toxic relationship my whole life, they were married for a few months and divorced a month before I was born, constantly in custody battles, and often used me to hurt each other. I was exposed to a lot of mental manipulation from both sides, but especially from my mom.

Since my dad’s passing, my mom says I can talk to her about how I'm feeling, but when I do, she reacts in really uncomfortable ways. She’ll say things like, ""You still have your mom,"" or ""I'm not dead yet,"" or she’ll roll her eyes and avoid sitting with me when I ask to talk. If I don’t talk, she gets upset. If I do talk, she gets offended. It's like I'm walking on eggshells no matter what.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

How do I protect my emotional space while still living with her? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of complicated parent relationship while grieving? I am so grateful for any advice.

"Hi, I need to make a decision on whether to keep or remove my right kidney+ureter, and the data I have so far is confusing to me (technically every result I have could be explained by inflammatory atypia, but the doctor seems to lean towards it being low-grade cancer). The doctor has recommended I think through my options, so I'm reaching out to this community to get your help (any similar examples, relevant info/research/guidance that could help me decide)

For context, I am a 60year old man who is otherwise healthy and has never had surgery or other major issues in my life. Nobody in my family history has had cancer. I do know many relatives who died after painful periods of dialysis though, hence my sensitivity in deciding whether to remove my kidney or not.

Below is the detailed chronological order of events:

1) My 2025 annual regular check-up identified the following in the ultrasound of my abdomen and chest: ""right gross hydronephrosis with hydroureter (upper) ? right PUJ obstruction"" 
It was recommended I contact a urologist about a kidney stone. I had been told about a small kidney stone in my 2024 annual check-up too but I ignored it and didn't make any lifestyle changes either (I used to not drink much water...)

2) I consulted Urologist #1, who recommended getting DTPA and CT scans. He was quite curt and didn't explain anything, and I got scared about doing a radioactive test so I decided to find another urologist to consult.

3) Meanwhile, I got a CT scan done: ""Gross right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to an enhancing lesion in the proximal ureter - HPE evaluation is suggested. A ureteric calculus at L5-S1 level is also noted. Right renal parenchymal thinning with mild reduced enhancement and delayed excretion - suggesting impaired renal function"". The kidney stone was noted as 1.3 x 0.9cm in size.

4) I also got a Creatinine test done: 1.18mg/dL

5) I consulted Urologist #2 in a separate hospital. He was more junior than the first one though so he seemed to overenthusiastically corroborate Urologist #1's findings and advocated for full right kidney+ureter removal ""just in case"".

6) At this point, I still hadn't found a urologist I felt comfortable with, so I identified Urologist #3 who is both senior and well respected. He was both better at explaining what is going on, and more conservative in approaching the problem, so I started following his advice. We scheduled Surgery #1 to remove the kidney stone, and take a biopsy. He managed to fragment the kidney stone but not entirely, and my ureter is super narrow by birth, so he wasn't able to get his telescoppe instruments up to the affected area to visualize and to biopsy. So we scheduled Surgery #2.

7) Meanwhile, I got a PET-CT scan done: ""Small area of focal high grade FDG uptake seen in circumferential mild enhancing soft tissue lesion in the proximal right ureter (at approx L3-L4 intervertebral level) over a length of 1.8cm and maximum thickness of 0.4cm, SUVmax 11.99. Perilesional prominent stranding in seen having indistinct fat planes with underlying psoas major muscle. Proximal hydroureteronephrosis noted with pelvic APD measuring - 4cm.""

8) We also got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #1: 
For sample 1: ""Smears and cell block show clusters of scattered benign urothelial cells and abundant crystalline material against a clear background. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""
For sample 2: ""Smears and cell block are predominantly hemorrhagic. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""

9) In Surgery #2, Urologist #3 managed to completely powder the kidney stone, and get a visual on the lesion and do the biopsy on the thickened right ureter. He ran an intraoperative biopsy test (Frozen section: cryostat sectioning, staining and microscopy): 
""FSA: focal urothelial hyperplasia with inflammation and atypia (? inflammatory). Final diagnosis on paraffin section.""

10) After the surgery, a second sample was submitted for more detailed biopsy. In this one, the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) done says ""The urothelial cells express CK7, while these are negative for CK20. p53 shows wild type expression."". The findings say ""Tiny tissue fragments are lined by hyperplastic urothelium. Focally the lining epithelium is polypoid and shows increased thickness of more than ten layers. The lining epithelial cells are fairly monotonous with mild nuclear enlargement. No mitotic activity is seen. The underlying edematous lamina propria contains lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The inflammatory cells extend into the overlying urothelium at places. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""
The final pathological diagnosis is listed as:
""A. Biopsy from thickened right ureter, intraoperative consultation: low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive.
B. Upper/mid right ureteric lesion: histomorphology favors a papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""

10) We got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #2: ""Hemorrhagic smears and cell block reveal few coherent and papillaroid clusters of urothelial cells showing mildly pleomorphic hyperchromatic oval to round nuclei with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The background shows few inflammatory cells comprising predominantly of neutrophils along with lymphocytes.
Final pathological diagnosis: cytological features are suggestive of low grade urothelial neoplasm, TPS Category V. A biopsy confirmation is essential.""

10) Urologist #3 interpreted these as being stage 1 transitional cell carcinoma, with the good news being the cancer cells have not penetrated any layers yet. He did recommend doing a DTPA test, and getting a second opinion on the biopsy from one of the best histopathologists around who has 40+ years experience with challenging cases.

11) DTPA result (remember that this was done only 11 days post-operation, so actual numbers may be higher post-recovery): 
""Left kidney: 86.5%, 44.2ml/min. 
Right kidney: 13.5%, 6.9ml/min. 
Total GFR: 51.1ml/min""

12) Second opinion on the biopsy samples:
""Microscopic appearance: The biopsy from the upper right ureter and mid ureter reveals benign polypoidal urothelial mucosa with an edematous stroma. On evaluation with IHC, p53 is not overexpressed and Mib-1 is extremely low & CK20 is negative.
Impression: Biopsy of a thickened right ureter and upper/mid right ureteric lesion: benign polypoidal inflamed urothelial mucosa with inflammatory atypia in the nuclei.""

13) Urologist #3 was completely dismissive of the second opinion for the biopsy. He stated that based on the first biopsy report, urine cytology results from Surgery #2, the visual he had when performing surgery, and the PET-CT report, he is convicted it is cancer and not atypia, and he recommends removing the kidney+ureter entirely. It is ultimately my choice though.","I’m not dismissing your concerns or the findings, but I’m not sure that this is something that opinions from people on Reddit should be addressing. And it doesn’t matter if you find somebody who had the same problem and had a kidney removed, it would not say what your results might be. There are other questions though: If you have the kidney removed, how does that change your life? what happens if you don’t have the kidney removed, and how quickly? If this turns into full blown kidney cancer, what does that look like? I would be scared and worried if this were me. And I will be interested to hear what you decide and how it goes. My best wishes.",concur

I panicked, and a couple hours later sent a message that I convinced myself was confident (it wasn't), '*hey enjoying this convo, let's meet in town and i'll buy us some food :)*', she said, '*id prefer to keep talking here for a bit first*'. Couple dead replies later I got unmatched. **ahh rejection**, how can something i know so well, hit my fkn core every single time.

**Feeling:** Fear  
**My explanation:** Losing interest  
**Action:** She's pulling away I need to save it.

When her replies slowed down, I thought to myself, 'I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE!', it's happened 1 million times before, at that point i may as well take drastic measures to meet, cos the ships sinking. Not realising, my inability to handle that panic, and just **let it pass**, was probably the VERY thing that she picked up as weird.

I thought that BECAUSE she lost interest, that's why I felt fear. If I just had awareness I'd have realised that the **fear came first**, and that **influenced** my explanation, and therefore my action. 

Which brings me to, wtf do i do about this? **Awareness.**

All you have to do, to overcome this is be aware that panic sits inside you. Nothing else, no breathing, no course, no gym. Just be aware and you'll be more free to move forward, without the chains of your past.

"Male 34. My success rate this year is 15%; in years past it was about 60-70% success rate!!??!?

I went from being generally appealing to being almost universally unappealing. I have gone on **30 first dates this year**. So my match and first date rate is probably still roughly the same though.

So many theories, based on solo ponderings and talks with chatGPT and friends...wondering what you guys think is most likely. 

1.  Had some healthy issues this year where I was in the hospital for a while and the medicine slowed down my metabolism a lot, so not as buff and in shape as I used to be, and i do have a shirtless muscular picture on my profile...but I'm wearing a shirt on a first date so I'm surprised being somewhat less fit in a way you cant even fully see would lead to crisis level drop in results.
2. Think I might be talking about dating too much on dates. chatGPT calls too meta and my friends call too ""intense"". Motivation for this is generally just interested in the topic as I even studied Behavioral Science in grad school and dating is like a microcosm (?) of that. So I read subreddits like this one a lot, and as you can see from the number of first dates I have done this year, I just have a lot of experience and insight into it and convinced if I dig into their perspective on it I can get insight into how much of a time waster they are.
3. I'm convinced as I get older and the people I date also collectively get older we are all just more tired nowadays in our thirties. Think I was maybe more high energy and ""on"" in years past.","""...convinced if I dig into their perspective I can get insight into how much of a time waster they are."" This sounds like you're coming into the dates very cynical and trying to catch them with bad traits you have no reason to be suspicious of. Like if they say a particular thing you'd be all ""Gotcha! I knew you were a time waster and you just revealed yourself!"" No one wants to be on the receiving end of that kind of conversation, or feel like you're assuming the worst of them before you even get to know them.

TLDR: I have a benign bronchial duplication cyst that makes me wonder if my LC is actually just symptoms of this chest mass and I’m being deceived into thinking I have long COVID be bad doctors. Also had my 16th er visit the other day. 


I’m sure that what everyone here is experiencing is happening, so I don’t mean “oh it’s all in our heads” or whatever. But for me personally I have another issue that makes me doubt if I’m suffering from LC or not. During my first ER appointment they found a noticeable mass in my chest which has been pretty well investigated. It’s a congenital bronchial duplication “cyst.”The thoracic surgeon told me they don’t usually cause the issues I am experiencing, like vision problems and cognitive issues- however they do causes swallowing problems and shortness of breath, chest pressure, that sort of thing. So half of my problems at least could be related to that, and in rare cases maybe even the neuro stuff!! But it’s also rare for these things to even cause noticeable symptoms at all, so I have no way of knowing. 

I would say 80% of doctors I see have never heard of long COVID so when I see someone new they bring up the chest mass and then I start wondering all over again if my problems really are all from this mass and I’m just deluding myself about the long COVID. The rest of the time if people do think it’s COVID I get nothing out of it.

I went to the ER for the sixteenth time in 2 years the other night… I’ve been 16 times for real. It was like 1am and I had been woken up with terrible left sided weird issues again and felt like maybe I was having some cardiac problem. Just awful. Numb, suffocating chest neck left arm, sob, the usual, but worse. The doctor who saw me was good, and she insisted I needed a primary to really be keeping up with me, and told me to be aggressive. She questioned me about the chest mass and refered my cardio thoracic surgery.

I’m just so tired of this. It took me 5 month to even get scheduled with cardiology and it will be another 2 months to get seen. I made 30 phone calls trying to get scheduled. I even sent them the damn ekg they “maybe” needed myself and they never could access it. I’m not sure how to be MORE aggressive, and at this point I hate myself for even being polite anymore. I was never a pushy or demanding person, but now it’s like the fact that I’m not a raging entitled asshole is working against me because the medical system is so bad. 

Having all this uncertainty for 2 years is so draining. Is it the chest cyst? Is it just LC because it has all those symptoms too but you’ll never know because you can’t test for it?? Is it BOTH? What if I end up getting surgery to have it removed and it solves NOTHING and then I have to heal from chest surgery and have long COVID. What if I never even had long COVID and they were wrong about this cyst and it’s pressing on my nerves and that’s why I can’t use my hands properly anymore when I’m upright. 

The cognitive haze is just horrible. The number one thing that makes me think I’m dealing with LC is the brain fog, because no one else is describing it like the people on here who have it. 

I don’t know why I’m even writing this. I know nobody here has an answer either, and everyone is suffering. I just really hope I get some sort of solid answers soon because life where every single one of your senses and activities is impacted is really the final test of endurance","Yeah I’ve been told by certain specialists it sounds like it but I seem to be worse than most people on this threat and I never had crashes or remissions at all , just 24/7 disabling symptoms",concur

"Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.","Thanks its a good contribution to the efficiency literature, the way it combines the two axes makes total sense.

"My husband (M30) and I (F28) have been together for 10 years. We are not legally married but we have lived together for 5 years and in our state that makes us domestic partners. We have both changed so much individually and as a couple. There is one recent change, however, that has completely altered our relationship and I'm afraid of what the next steps might be. 

From the very moment we met I was sure about one thing for my future. I wanted to adopt children in lieu of having my own. Anyone i told said that i would grow out of it someday but I never have. I have always felt very strongly about this. From a very young age, I was sure of how I wanted to start my family. I understand not everyone is comfortable with adoption so when my husband and I started dating I made that very clear to him. That I was only interested in adoption and had no plans of birthing any biological children. He accepted that and never said anything negative about it. 

I have never wavered. Anytime we talk about our future family it was always in the pretense of adoption. I made it clear at every opportunity I could and he never said anything different. That was until two years ago. He started making small comments on how we would make cute children or smart children or whatever. I would agree but also followed up with a, ""but I guess we will never know."" And he let it go everytime. In hindsight, i should have known then that he wasnt being honest about his wants. Every couple of months he would just make small comments like that so I would remind him of our plan and he would immediately agree. That was until a few days ago.

After his best friends wedding, who also just had a baby, my husband admitted to me that he wants his own biological children. That we can adopt too but he wants ""his own"". I felt and still feel very hurt. He asked me to think about it more and I didnt say anything. I was just so stunned he felt this way. Had he always felt this way? I believed we wanted the same things. If we do adopt AND have our own I dont believe he will treat them equally. I believe he will treat his biological children with bias and do the bare minimum for the adopted child. At that point, it just defeats the whole purpose.

I love my husband so much and if we wants his own biological children then I don't want to get in the way of that but I also don't want to be apart of it. I want him to have the future he wants but I also want the same for myself. I feel so hurt and like I just wasted years of my life because he couldn't just be honest with me. I'm afraid of starting over after being with him for so long but it's clear that our wants for life are pulling us in different directions. I'm glad he was finally honest with himself and had the courage to tell me but I believe this marks the end for us. I'm looking into apartments, trying to figure out what I can afford and get out of our house as soon as possible. I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm tired and i can't believe that this is where I'm at.







","I mean, if you have been together 10 years, you were only 18 and 20 when you started dating. Not all 20 year olds know whether they'll want kids or not. One of my friends from childhood swore up and down she never ever wanted to be pregnant, and now has a beautiful baby with her husband. People change their minds, and some people know the second they think about it. It sucks that it has been so long and you don't want the same thing as each other anymore. However as other people have said, you are only 28. Life is far from over. Some people get married, divorce, and start over at 30, 40, even 50. It's never too late. You've got this.",concur
"EDIT - we met up this morning and he ended it. He said he’s told me a million times that he is secular and that the main reason that “tipped him over the edge” was the fact that I have been making out that he is lying. I was gobsmacked and asked him why this is and he said that he has explained his religion vs traditional culture to me many times and that because I “keep asking him about it” it makes him think that there is no trust. I told him that that is not the case at all and that whilst I remember bits of what he’s told me about his tradition and his views there has never been any conversation about what he expects from myself. I also reminded him that a few weeks ago I proactively brought it up and said that I wanted to understand it more (when we were chilling and watching TV) and he said he was too tired to chat about it. He responded by saying that that is beside the point… he then walked off. 😔😔😔


We’ve been dating for 6 months now (I’m 36f and he’s 38m) and everything had been going great. We have had little disagreements but they’ve been dealt with in an emotionally mature way. I love this man so much and honestly thought he was/is the one so I feel heartbroken and torn apart . 

I attended a Sunday dinner at my boyfriend’s auntie’s house last week and felt confused and out of place because I was the only non-Christian attendee. My boyfriend told me that it would be a religious affair and that there would be singing. I assumed that it would be fun singing but instead it was incredibly formal and more like hymns. 

I called him this morning to talk through the dinner from last Sunday because I was still mulling it over. He tells me he’s not religious but then he knew all the prayers by heart, so I’m confused. During the phone call I start asking him questions about it and I tell him that I’m confused. He reacts badly and says that this conversation is weird. I reiterated that I didn’t have a bad time at the thinner but that it was way more formal than I thought it would be and I did express some concerns about my role in this. Would I be expected to go to these dinners on a regular basis? Do I need to know the hyms? Etc et  

Fast forward 6 hours, he texts me and I can tell he is super pissed off, he is saying that he is not religious but practices the traditions and that he feels like I misinterpreted him and his family and he feels disrespected. I explain that I am not trying to poke him but instead I’m wanting to learn about it so that I can take things on board for our future. I also told him that I flew to the Middle East years ago to work for a Christian aid think tank… So I am definitely not opposed to the religion. And I was still so confused as to Why has he taken this the wrong way?? I’m confused about the distinction between what is a tradition and what is religion and what role (if any I would I’ve to play).  The only thing that I specifically thought we had discussed is having our children baptised but he said this would be a tradition which I agreed with. 

He then started to get angry and said “I am not a religious Christian who is practising but I was born one. And the fact that I am having to convince you that I am not Christian is weird and unacceptable and I will never justify myself to anyone. My family are my world and you have issues with them. I am appalled that I asked you to be my girlfriend. I couldn’t care about religion but this is my culture and I won’t tolerate being interrogated by you ever again. We can chat tomorrow”. 

Any advice on how I navigate this? I genuinely want to understand and support him but he’s taken my questions as disrespect. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations where your partner identifies with a religion culturally but claims not to be religious? How do I approach this without him feeling attacked? And did my actions warrant his angry reaction? 😫😫😫

Edit: Something I just remembered, he has been working flat out for most of our relationship and has a new job in accounting. He has told me numerous times that at this moment in time (over the next 6 months or so), he has de-prioritised social events with friends but still made time to see me. He said that once his probation ends he will become more “normal” with his work life balance. So I think what I was trying to get at is how often would 
 I have to attend these things when his work has calmed down as last night was the first time. I did not communicate that to him btw which I should have done 

Also an example of our past disagreements… he has loads of photos on Facebook of him with loads of girls out partying (these photos are months apart and not every weekend). And in about 7/8 photos he has his arms wrapped around girls with them kissing his cheeks. In the first month of us dating I showed my friend his Facebook and she saw all of the photos, and said that he looks like a player. Prior to this I had only seen two of these types of photos and had not done a detailed look at his FB like my friend so I had a wierd feeling about it. I called him up a few hours later when she’d gone and asked him about it calmly. I remember saying that I want to understand why these photos are there because it infers that you’re not after a relationship? I also followed up with that I get the opposite impression from you in real life so it’s confusing for me. He got very very defensive and said that he can have any photos that he wants on social media etc etc and that I should trust him for who he is in person. I can’t exactly remember how the conversation ended but he reassured me that he doesn’t want a casual fling. So maybe this is contributing to how he’s feeling now ",Looked at your post history OP. This whole thing is a mess. You’ve had issues dating this guy from day one and it seems like you both need to step back and really work on yourselves. Just 47 days ago you posted that you were in a situationship. He’s had problems with alcohol. Yikes.,concur
"I (37F) recently met a wonderful person (38M). We've been dating for a little over two months and made the relationship official a few weeks ago. Everything is still very fresh. I am falling in love, but we haven't expressed that to each other yet, so I don't know how he's feeling exactly except that he really likes me and says he wants a long-term relationship with me. The thing is, he very recently got out of a long-term relationship, as in they broke up officially a month before we met (although he says the breakup was happening for a year). The situation that led to that breakup was that they were in a long-distance relationship and his ex-partner requested opening up the relationship. They tried that for a year, but he only started going on dates last fall. There were other problems in the relationship, some of which he has told me about, that contributed to it ending. It wasn't my partner's first time having an open relationship, although he has expressed to me that he prefers monogamy. I'm open to ethical non-monogamy, but perhaps lean towards monogamy. Or, at least, I have my own ways of rejecting traditional monogamy that don't necessarily involve multiple romantic and/or sexual partners.

I was initially a little hesitant to get involved with my partner because I was worried he hadn't had time to process the breakup and that it could end in my getting hurt. So far, it hasn't been an issue. But two weeks ago, his ex was in town to pick up her stuff from their formerly shared apartment and bring back his things that had been at her apartment out of town. Last night, we had a more serious talk because he's been feeling low and it came out that, although it was somehow a relief that the relationship is more officially over, this has also brought on feelings of sadness, which I can completely understand. However, it has also brought on doubts on his part about whether he should be in a new relationship so soon. He's conflicted, though, because he really likes me and wants a relationship with me.

While the talk we had has left me feeling a bit more cautious and guarded, it also left me wondering what, if anything, I can do to give him space to mourn his relationship that ended without it having a negative impact on ours. I feel a bit insecure. I know in ethically non-monogamous relationships it must be more common to be in a similar kind of situation. Could anyone who has experience with that offer some compassionate advice?","Oooophhhh, I would be politely bowing out of this situation if I were in your shoes.",oppose
"I have been working at my job for a year now and I’m still entry level. I realized I made a mistake that’s small but affects majority of the numbers in the excel file, and this file is from months ago and we submitted it for the purpose of predicting trends. That’s why it’s important. Nobody else seemed to have noticed it if they did they would’ve said something. But here is the thing: my boss was on medical leave for a whole month when I was finishing it up and I was required to submit the final draft to a secure website before my boss could officially upload it to this other site. So I’m not even sure if my boss even looked at the file one last time before uploading it since she trusted me with the revision and finalizing things. I already made another mistake at work that was more minor that I already owned up to and was terrified over it. Thankfully my boss and the CFO forgave me and even pointed out how impressed they were with me that I was able to be self accountable. But my boss literally trusted me with the entire process of this specific project while she was on leave, she commented how proud she was that I was being attentive which I WAS with everything else but this particular mistake is small but it affects basically the whole thing. I’m scared, I’m gonna get fired and I literally can’t get fired. I’m escaping a toxic environment and I am one month away from moving out I already signed a lease. I am normally very attentive and careful but this isn’t the first time I made a careless mistake like this.

Context: I’m a financial analyst and the project was essentially to predict how much in revenue and expenses we would have by the end of 2026. And part of that has to do with how many members we would have throughout the entire calendar year of 2026. The mistake was that I accidentally put in the wrong number for the monthly membership net growth. It was supposed to be 2 but instead I put 4, and that impacts the $ amounts for almost everything but thankfully not significantly. But I’m still worried. ","Take a deep breath. This mistake, while stressful, is likely more fixable than it feels right now. Financial models get revised constantly as new data emerges, and a net growth variance from 2 to 4 members monthly is relatively minor in the grand scheme of forecasting. Your best move is to own this proactively, just like you did with your previous mistake that actually impressed leadership. Prepare a brief explanation of the error, its impact on the projections, and present the corrected version. Frame it as catching an error during your quality review process rather than a crisis. You can use a service like Applyre to quietly explore backup options while handling this situation. However, given that your boss praised your accountability before and trusted you with significant responsibility during her leave, you've built credibility that should work in your favor here. The timing is tough with your move coming up, but companies rarely fire employees over minor forecasting errors, especially ones who demonstrate accountability and strong work ethic. Most organizations expect some revision cycles in financial projections. Address it Monday morning professionally, show the corrected numbers, and emphasize your commitment to accuracy going forward. Your track record of responsibility will likely carry more weight than this single mistake.",oppose
"# The Latin word for ""left"" literally means ""evil"" - and this linguistic programming has been sabotaging human potential for centuries

**TL;DR: I discovered that most ""genetic limitations"" might actually be unoptimized bilateral brain development caused by centuries of cultural programming against the left side of our bodies. Simple experiments you can try yourself included.**

---

## The Mind-Blowing Etymology That Started Everything

So I'm down a research rabbit hole about bilateral brain integration when I discover this:

**Latin: ""Sinistra"" (left) → English: ""Sinister"" (evil/wrong)**  
**Latin: ""Dexter"" (right) → English: ""Dexterous"" (skillful/correct)**

Wait, WHAT? 

The words for left and right literally encode ""left = evil, right = good"" into our language. And it gets worse:

**""Ambidextrous"" literally means ""two right hands""** - even the word for bilateral skill assumes right-hand superiority!

This isn't just linguistic trivia. This is **systematic cultural programming** that's been suppressing half of human potential for centuries.

---

## The Personal Discovery That Changed Everything

Here's where it gets weird. I started noticing something about my walking:

**When I start walking with my RIGHT foot:** My left foot can't match the stride. Even when I consciously try to make them equal, my left foot feels clumsy and out of sync.

**When I start walking with my LEFT foot:** They instantly move in perfect tandem. Effortless bilateral coordination.

This blew my mind. **My right-brain (controlling left foot) is naturally good at bilateral integration. My left-brain (controlling right foot) sucks at it.**

So I started experimenting...

---

## The 6-Month Bilateral Integration Experiment

I spent months systematically developing my non-dominant side:

- **Switched my watch to opposite hand** (simple bilateral cue)
- **Started gym exercises with weak side first** (instead of dominant → tired weak side)
- **Practiced left-handed writing on graph paper** 
- **Used left-hand computer mouse** with foot pedals for navigation
- **Switched sleeping sides when I had pain**

**Results:**
- **Noticeably clearer thinking** and better pattern recognition
- **Improved right-handed golf swing** from learning left-handed 
- **Better right-handed penmanship** from left-handed practice
- **Reduced pain patterns** from bilateral movement variation
- **Enhanced problem-solving** through what felt like ""whole brain"" thinking

---

## The Science That Backs This Up

Turns out there's actual research supporting bilateral integration:

**Corpus Callosum Development:** The neural bridge connecting brain hemispheres literally grows thicker through bilateral coordination training. Musicians have measurably larger corpus callosi from using both hands.

**Mind-Muscle Connection Research:** Studies show 20-60% increased muscle activation when you consciously focus on specific muscles during exercise.

**Rate of Force Development:** Most people achieve only 40% of their potential muscle activation in the first 50ms of movement (range: 10-800%). This is trainable.

**Hemispheric Specialization:** Left brain = logical/systematic, Right brain = creative/spatial. Most people only optimize one side.

---

## Simple Experiments You Can Try Right Now

**The Watch Switch:** 
Wear your watch on the opposite wrist for a day. Notice how it feels different and affects your movement awareness.

**The Gym Flip:**
Next workout, start every exercise with your weak side first. Feel how much better attention and energy your weak side gets.

**The Writing Challenge:**
Try writing your name with your non-dominant hand. Now try some left-handed writing on graph paper. Notice if your dominant hand writing improves.

**The Gait Test:**
Pay attention to which foot you naturally start walking with. Try consciously starting with the opposite foot. Does one feel more coordinated?

**The Sleep Switch:**
If you always sleep on one side, try the opposite side for one night. (Especially if you have pain on your usual side.)

---

## The Bigger Picture: What If ""Genetics"" Is Actually Optimization?

Here's my controversial hypothesis: **What we call genetic limitations might often be unoptimized bilateral development.**

Think about it:
- **1940s-1990s:** Teachers literally forced left-handed kids to write right-handed because ""left = wrong""
- **Every tool is designed for right-hand dominance** (scissors, equipment, etc.)
- **All gym equipment has single anchor points** creating systematic bilateral dysfunction
- **Athletes get locked into asymmetrical patterns** (three-point stance, batting stance) for years

**We've created a civilization that systematically suppresses bilateral development, then wonder why people feel ""half-functional.""**

---

## The Athletic Connection

I played football (fullback) in college. Thousands of repetitions in the same three-point stance. Right side always loaded, left side always trailing.

**Years later, I realized:** Those ""phantom pain patterns"" and movement asymmetries weren't just aging - they were **pattern imprisonment** from athletic programming.

**The breakthrough:** Consciously practicing opposite-side athletic positions helped release patterns I didn't even know I was carrying.

---

## Why This Matters

If bilateral integration is trainable (which research suggests it is), then:

- **Cognitive limitations** might be hemispheric disconnection rather than fixed capacity
- **Movement dysfunction** might be pattern imprisonment rather than inevitable aging  
- **Athletic performance** could be enhanced through bilateral development rather than just dominant-side optimization
- **Creative blocks** might be solved through systematic bilateral brain integration

---

## The Cultural Programming Goes Deep

**Left-handed people know this instinctively.** They've been forced to develop bilateral adaptation their whole lives. They're walking examples of what systematic bilateral integration can achieve.

**Equipment examples:**
- Left-handed scissors don't exist in most stores
- Computer mice, tools, instruments - all designed for right-hand dominance
- Even **gym equipment** is systematically biased (try using a lat pulldown machine - notice how the knee pads slope to accommodate right-leg dominance, or any single anchored leg extension machine)

**We've built a world that forces adaptation on 10% of people while letting 90% operate in systematic bilateral dysfunction.**

---

## Try This For One Week

Pick ONE of these experiments:

1. **Switch your watch hand** and notice how it affects your movement awareness
2. **Start with weak side first** in any physical activity (gym, sports, daily tasks)
3. **Practice writing/drawing with non-dominant hand** for 10 minutes daily
4. **Consciously alternate which foot starts your walking** throughout the day
5. **Try sleeping on opposite side** if you have any pain or always sleep the same way

**Pay attention to:**
- Changes in coordination or comfort
- Any improvements in your dominant side performance
- Shifts in thinking clarity or problem-solving
- Different sensations or awareness in your body

---

## The ""Why Not?"" Philosophy

Here's the thing: **these experiments cost nothing and take minimal time**. Even if I'm completely wrong about the bigger theory, bilateral coordination training has documented benefits.

**But if I'm right?** We might be sitting on the biggest human optimization opportunity in history, hiding in plain sight because we've been linguistically programmed to ignore half our potential.

**Worst case:** You develop better coordination and cognitive flexibility.  
**Best case:** You unlock capabilities you didn't know you had.

Why not find out?

## Questions For Discussion

- Have you noticed bilateral asymmetries in your own movement or thinking?
- Does the linguistic programming angle (sinistra = sinister) change how you think about left/right bias?
- What happens when you try the simple experiments? 
- Are there other cultural assumptions about ""genetics"" that might actually be optimization opportunities?

**I'm genuinely curious about your experiences.** This could be completely wrong, partially right, or the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Let's find out together.",Sounds like someone left handed would say,concur
"I wanted to follow up on my previous post about my experience with Methylene blue (MB):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1lny077/methylene\_blue\_is\_helping\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1lny077/methylene_blue_is_helping_me/)

I am definitely convinced MB has provided the greatest improvement in the 4  years I have had long covid. I would say now that I have moved up to 8 out 10, I still have some symptoms but greatly reduced.

A couple of weeks ago I thought maybe improved sleep helped, perhaps it has added to the improvement or maybe its just some kind of arbitrary remission, I mean who knows with long covid but in the last week I am convinced it is  MB is helping me.

I worked on improving my sleep first, i had this crazy go to sleep at 11pm and then wake up every 2-3 hrs until 10 am and still didnt feel great. Dr prescribed zopiclone and I was on it for 6 months and it was useless except if i stopped taking it I had worse insomnia, I decided to quit and it took a week to get back to long covid erratic sleep. I ended up trying melatonin which helped for a while and then I tried Valarian. It has helped the most, it feels like melatonin helped straighten out my sleep cycle and valarian helps me sleep. I take 1.5 ml of a tincture. I think due to MB there are some nights I am not tired until midnight.

On to MB,

I have been holding steady taking 2-3 drops not every day, if I feel as good as I did the day before then I skip taking it that day. If I take 2 one day and 3 the next then I feel slightly jittery with no real difference.

Its been about 5-6 weeks now and the results have remained steady. Due to circumstances I wasnt able to take MB for 5 days and I definately regressed, when I resumed MB I  bounced right back the same day so to me this was proof MB is specifically helping me.

A few more observations:

\- I didnt mention in my last post that I was very sensitve to heat, many days last summer the second I stepped out into the sun it felt like it was burning me, there were a few times when I had to go out for a few minutes I felt wiped out and had to lie down. But last weekend I spent an hour in directl sunlight, it was a 100 degrees (30 degrees f) slaving over a BBQ for my church BBQ and it felt great, I was sweating like crazy but it felt good to sweat. I worked 6hrs straight on this BBQ and was really tired but bounced back the next day after a good nights sleep.

Twice in the past week I walked several KMs (1 mile) I was sore, muscle sore due to being a sedentary old man rather than body aches from long covid. I feel great 

My brain fog is not perfectly lifted but it feels like every day my executive brain function is back. I was able to hatch an elaborate daily plan to further my caeer plus exercise. I made a promise to myself that if I ever got better I would learn to run (I ran 10k 15 years ago) and get back to skiing next winter. ( I used to be a great skier)   I do notice I am not always on my game but I also have a list of easier tasks to do so I am always moving forward and productive.

I think that covers it, I probably wont post again unless I regress or something else drastic happens.","Thank you for the update. Can you reiterate how much you are taking? I'm a little confused, probably long Covid brain. Exciting progress!",concur

"I (30f) am dating someone (35m) exclusively and am contending with 2 big things - my divorce (final court date tbd) and his travel schedule (1-3 weeks per month, usually a couple days to a week between trips). We've been exclusive for about a month. Since neither of us is wild about the term gf/bf, and that seems too soon, it feels like our relationship is sort of on pause then fully back on when he's in town. My female friends all think this is a plus since he and I are in weird personal circumstances and have been really open with communication/support. My male friends have been throwing in pretty judgemental/contentious questions and discussions of red flags (for instance, how we text each other and how often; that I'd taken the lead in the define the relationship talk; the importance of letting a guy pursue you; him not being who they imagined for me - he's an athletic quiet guy whereas I usually go for lanky charismatic guys - kind of touchy stuff since my exes have leaned toward the possessive/jealous type and were sort of sad boy nerd musicians).

I feel positive about my relationship overall. I have my weaker moments, like before a trip where I worry about missing him too intensely or when he gets back and I feel nervous like we're going to have to start all over again. But when we're in person I feel connected, and when we're apart and I'm in a good headspace I feel equally excited and comfortable about having him in my life. We're both serious, private people and have each been in 1 LTR. We still find a lot of levity and spark together (laughing and sex have been particularly helpful to me right now in a way that dating around, worrying about putting my best foot forward, and swiping through the apps wasn't). Idk if it'll go anywhere, but I'm willing to take that risk. 

So here's the rub. I can't tell if I'm just being overly sensitive about my female v male friends' takes on this relationship. Maybe it boils down to a base difference in how they might act if they were in my/his shoes. I want to continue talking about my dating life with all my friends but am questioning if I need to adjust my boundaries with them or if there's a bigger problem with their motives? I haven't talked to male friends about relationship stuff in years - tbh my ex was always weird about my prior male friendships so I kept in closer contact with mutual male friends (I don't talk to any of them now, womp womp of my marriage ending and impacting my social circle). I don't date male friends or remove them from the friendzone ever (lost a best friend that way years ago). They know this. I guess what I'm trying to get at is: are my guy friends right about this relationship (is it full of red flags) or are they projecting (what they might want with someone, or possibly jealousy because they want that for me)?

Edits for grammar/clarity 
",So…why do your friends have so much weight on this romantic relationship? Are any of your male friends actually happy for you? Do they see you as an actual woman capable of her own happiness and in control of her own life or is this something a male is supposed to dominate and control? Why the fuck do they care how often you text each other if you’re in a relationship? Maybe you need to evaluate your relationships with the opposite sex and why you gravitate towards guys who feel that talking to you like this is ok.,concur
"I (30M) have a younger brother (26M) who was born with severe physical and cognitive disabilities. Growing up, everything in our household revolved around him, appointments, therapies, meltdowns, accommodations. I was the “normal” kid, expected to understand and adjust.

And I did. On the outside. But inside? I hated it.

I hated missing birthday parties because he couldn’t handle crowds. I hated that my parents forgot to come to my school play because he had a seizure that day. I hated that I never got to be seen.

"Yes two questions on the same post. These situations happened to me recently. 

First: I (35F) was in a block party with some friends, my boyfriend didn’t attend because he was travelling. There was this guy from the beer stall who hit on me every time I went to buy beer (only stall at the party), and when the stall closed he came to our group to talk to us and make personal questions about me. My friend’s husband noticed that I was uncomfortable and took the lead on talking to him. I didn’t cut him because I live abroad and can’t really speak the language and he didn’t speak English. The day after my bf came back from the trip, asked me about the block party, how was the music, how was the food, etc. i told him about everything but didn’t mention the guy, even though I was asking myself if I should. Not like a report, but casually, as something that was part of my evening out with my friends. 

Second: I was travelling with a friend this last weekend, in a city 250km away from where we live. I had to go to a store to buy some stuff for the day at the beach, and when I was crossing the street when leaving the store, there was this guy I went on a couple of dates with last year. We were confused because none of us expected to meet there, but we talked briefly, he said he was there for a wedding and invited me for a drink. I said I had plans and we said good bye. Later that evening I was in the phone with my boyfriend and he asked about my day, where we went to, how was the beach, if I liked the city etc. Same thing, I wondered if I should casually mention that I met this guy totally coincidentally and unexpectedly, after one year without seeing him, there, of all places. But decided not to. 

How do you guys deal with these situations? Talk? Not talk? It is not that this has been bothering me, but I am Open to any insights

"I researched prion disease contagion mechanisms in the early 90's. More and more research is classifying Alzheimers as a prion disease (mis-conformations of natural proteins that the body cannot digest). Mad-cow disease (BSE) is a prion disease heavily linked to the similar human diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). Bottom line is that these prion diseases are known to be contagious to humans, primarily by ingesting parts of a prion diseased animal. **I believe that this could also happen from getting the blood of a prion diseased human into an open wound of another. I also suspect that if someone is an IV drug user, and share needles with someone who has, or later develops Alzheimers, then they are at risk as well.**

"Title pretty much sums it up.

I’m beyond sick of my wife drinking herself to oblivion. She ruins date nights, anniversaries, family vacations, etc.

Tired of the empty promises.

Tired of her blaming me for her sloppiness.

Tired of the selfishness.

What sucks is I’ve been faithful to this woman for 20+ years. I’m an attractive man with options that I never pursue because I strongly believe in marriage vows. 

Every single family vacation we’ve had she drinks herself into a stupor and I end up going downstairs to the hotel bar and just sitting there alone. Women have hit on me and I turn them away. 

We have 3 beautiful children and they are the main reason I remain.

Does she have an alcohol problem? Clearly. But I also believe she has a selfishness problem.

Not sure what to do at this point as we’ve talked ad nauseam about everything and it’s just endless empty promises and nothing ever changes.

I don’t believe in divorce. But, at this point, she’s just not a loving partner. Breaks my heart to admit this.","Alcoholism is a disease with only one way to treat it successfully, and that is for the alcoholic to never drink alcohol again. You could force your wife into rehab and get her sober but she’s the only one that can maintain that sobriety. You can throw out every drop of alcohol in the house but she will buy more and hide it. Until and unless she wants sobriety, it won’t happen. She has to want it for herself and be willing to do the work and it’s not easy. Your wife’s drinking also affects your children no matter what extremes you go to hide it from them. Talk to them about their mothers drinking and be honest about how you feel. Chances are, they’ve already discussed it amongst themselves. Take a good look at your life. You’ve honored your vows even when you’ve had opportunities not to. Look ahead 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. Then visualize looking back on a life filled with anger, animosity and unhappiness is that what you want to remember of your life?

"Hi. 

I'm writing here becuase I'm unable to sleep. 

Its been 6 months since my last update, I'm now almost 8 months pregnant and my daughter is 5 now. She is a sweetheart.  

My last months have been rough.  Life is beating me up like if I was the one who stole baby Jesus' pacifier.  

My ex was very respectful the very few weeks. He came regularly to pick our daughter, put his share of money, was attentive with me and I thought whoa, maybe this is going to hurt like hell for a long time but its gonna work. My mom and my sister were great! I swear this pregnancy has been easy, sometimes I forget I'm pregnant. 

I FOUND out the reason of Eliza and ex fallout. And learned it directly from Eliza's mouth. She called me one day and say she would like some words. I wasn't sure but we met. She said she wanted to apologize for a couple of things: not realizing _how_ badly intrusive she was in my marriage (she knew she was but did not realized how bad it was and how toxic). Enjoying the influece she has on my husband. Knowing he would do as she pleased gave her a sense of control she didn't have in her life. And she apologized for all the pain she caused me. 

We are no friends or anything. I'm trying my best to no hate her but I'm glad that finally my feelings and insecurities were validated. 

*On their fallout out* Apparently when my ex was sleeping with a friend, at some point between when he left the house and when he returned begging to save our family; 2 male friends, Eliza and my ex where having drinks, they were drunk but no wasted. Eliza went outside to smoke and my followed her and tried to kiss her, she rejected him, asked what the fuck and my ex went all romantic about the fire he felt for her, he was full of fire for her. It was always her. She laughed and called him patetic. 

She told me that so I know exactly what kind man he is. 

Now the rough part, after a couple of weeks he started to press again for being together. One day he was being so agresive about it that when I said I would die first before being with him he grabbed me by my arm  and left a mark. 

He basically disappeared. He isnt helping with child support and I'm alone paying for everything.  I'm really struggling.  

When I do see him he mocks me saying we could live better if we were together. 

I'm so glad I dont love him anymore. ",Tell him your fire doesn't burn for him like his does for ex.,oppose

I just chuckle, but I am also like what's the point? We haven't been talking, there's no pending or unanswered messages, so I don't think either of us were interested. Maybe it makes them feel better... My recommendation is either send a message within a day or two of meeting to let them know, or just leave it and mutually ghost one another.

"For years, my identity was a graveyard of brilliant careers I could have had. The Substack founder, the AI-tool tinkerer, the artist with a pottery wheel still in its box.

I was addicted to the dopamine of planning. It felt like progress, but it was just a risk-free fantasy. The imagined version of me is a flawless writer; the real me faces a blinking cursor and crippling self-doubt.

I finally realized I wasn't scared of failing. I was scared the messy, imperfect *process* would ruin the perfect *idea* of me. This hit me hard. My entire self-worth was tied to a fantasy.

The shift wasn't about finding more motivation. It was a conscious change in tactics. **Here is the practical framework I used:**

1. **The Goal is the Action, Not the Outcome.** Stop trying to ""become a painter."" The only goal is to ""paint for 15 minutes today."" Showing up *is* the win. This immediately shifts you from paralyzed to active.
2. **Give Yourself Permission to Be Bad.** My first goal on the pottery wheel wasn't to make a beautiful bowl, but an ugly one. On purpose. This detached my ego from the outcome and freed me to just touch the clay. It’s about the physical act, not the performance.
3. **Chase Tiny, Unimpressive Progress.** Forget the high of some future success. Learn to love the small wins. The moment my focus shifted from ""becoming a ceramicist"" to ""this handle is slightly less wobbly than the last one,"" everything changed. That’s the new reward.

The ghosts of my potential selves are still around, but they don't haunt me anymore. I’m learning that the most impressive thing I can build isn't a flawless future in my head.

"So my brother (11 M) was diagnosed with ADHD at a young age. He’s medicated, he’s been switching meds hoping for progress but nothing. His biggest issue is eating all the snacks, even when medicated he eats only snacks and no meals my mom and dad have threatened to take away the snacks from the house but he continues.

My parents genuinely don’t know what to do, nobody else in our family is diagnosed with ADHD. Any advice on what to do","Does he have a psychiatrist or other specialist? They're the best people to talk to about these sorts of symptoms. It could be that there's more to it than ADHD which should be looked at. From the POV of someone with ADHD (and I could be very wrong), these seem like two different symptoms, one caused by executive dysfunction (the piss bottles - it could be hard to do the steps involved with getting up and going to the toilet) and the need for immediate reward/inability to postpone reward (eating snacks right away instead of holding off for meal times). It may be that having the snacks inaccessible will help your brother. Or even just having an alotment available for the day. My partner keeps our treats stuff in a lock box so I have to ask him for it... sometimes that's just something you have to do. Try not to think of it like a punishment, it's more of a tool to help him manage his symptoms. The pee thing is harder, I'm not sure what I can suggest there. A lot of people with ADHD get labelled as being naughty from a young age when they're actually really struggling to do things 'right'. I encourage you to try and reserve judgement with your brother and be kind - ADHD can be annoying to deal with for everyone involved. That 'naughty' label can really affect how you feel about yourself and makes it harder to manage the condition. I know this doesn't make it easier, but it is probably just as hard if not harder for your brother right now.

We have great communication skills and have gotten through pretty much every problem we’ve ever had, with no big fights.

His only faults really are that he’s on his phone A LOT and plays video games most nights until 2am. 

But I can’t shake this feeling that it’s all too good to be true.

She said that she doesn't believe that we could work things out and wants to get divorced. I didn't really have any objection to this and agreed.

She honestly sounded very sorry and not sorry not at the same time. It was weird. Anyways, we are going to meet up on Saturday to discuss the specifics and both of us have a lawyer that will be there with us. I'm not looking forward to that conversation.

Update: After seeing a bunch of comments that my wife may have cheated, I called her at work and talked with her. I asked what prompted this so suddenly and she was being short at first but eventually said she had slept with a woman on a work trip. Then confessed it was a couple(man and wife). She had gone to New York last month and met this couple and went to their room after drinks. 

I hung up the phone and haven't responded to any of her calls or messages. Right now I'm sitting in my office unsure of what I'm going to do. 

Thank you all for the comments. I really appreciate the support here. If anyone has some divorce tips I'll take them.

My wife and I have been married for 4 years. She has never said anything about being attracted to other women. 

Last week she sat me down and told me she is experiencing being attracted to women and would like to explore this. She said she would only do this for a year to ""get it out of her system."" 

I'm not comfortable with this and am not sure how to handle this. I told her I didn't want her to do this, but she said she needed to or would otherwise start to resent me. 

I'm at a loss for how to handle this. She is the love of my life and I don't know that I want her sleeping with women.

We've recently just moved into my parents house because we've had so many issues with the management at our apartment and we talked it out and decided we could also save a ton of money and pay off debt if we moved into my parents for a while. 

We planned on paying of debt as quickly as possible and then saving up a down-payment for a house. Good plan right? Well I have a history of recurring miscarriages and have already had complications with bleeding and cramping after moving around with this pregnancy so I've been trying to not do too much lifting or moving, which of course is terrible timing with trying to move on a time limit. Because of my limitations, I know most of the packing has been put on my partner and I've continuously have asked for my siblings and mom to go over and help my partner with packing and cleaning because I didn't want it to be all on him.

 He gets stressed out super easily and I know that could be playing a part in this situation, but when we were almost completely moved out he told me that he needed to talk to me and that I wasn't going to like what he had to say. I of course was panicking on the inside and trying not to freak out, but said okay let's talk. He told me that he talked to his therapist and has come to the realization that all his stress isn't coming from just work, but from me. That he's not sure he wants to be with me anymore and that he's tired of ""taking care of me"" and being responsible for me.

 (Gut punch) I cried, but I sat there and listened to everything he had to say about me and how he's been feeling. He said some very hurtful things and I wanted to say a lot of things but I held back because this was his time to tell me how he felt so I was trying to respect that, but it really really hurt to hear what he said. To clear some things up, I'm a stay at home mom, and I'm on disability, so I have a very small set income every month. But I do pay my own bills, phone, car insurance, gas, and some groceries where i can (so I don't fully understand how he's ""tired of taking care of me""). 

Yes, we knew I would be staying home with the kids way before we had our first kid, and we PLANNED our second kid, after 3 back to back miscarriages. So I'm heartbroken and confused where this is all coming from. Yes he's makes way more money than me, and the we majority of the bills and costs are on him, so I understand that he's stressed out, but this feels like it's coming out of nowhere right now. 

so now we're moved into my parents and he's been completely ignoring me. He won't hardly look at me or talk to me unless he needs to or I talk to him first. After the first week of ignoring me, when we were laying down he started cuddling me and we ended up having sex, but then the next day he went back to ignoring me again. I asked him if on his day off he wanted to go out and get coffee with me and spend some time together just the two of us, and he said he didn't think it was a good idea to be spending alone time with me. 

 That kind of did it for me honestly. So, he can ignore for a week, fuck me one night, and then go back to ignoring all while I'm pregnant and suffering emotionally and mentally through whatever this is. I'm scared to be a single mother, but i know i can do it if i have to. But I love my partner and have never even thought of a life without him these past 8 years. But with how he's been treating me I'm starting to resent him and don't know if I should even try anymore. I don't want to be with someone who makes me feel unloved and unappreciated. I'm heartbroken and so angry, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

*edit* The reason we haven't gotten married is because I'm on disability and would lose my medical insurance and benefits immediately if we got married. I have a lot of medical problems and can't afford to lose my medical. We have both basically acted and treated each other like we're already married though.

 I'm not trying to shit talk him because he's the best man I know and has truly cared for me and our son and has always put us first. He's just not acting like himself right now, and I don't know if it's the stress or if he is actually talking to someone else ",Kick him out of your parents house and prepare for life as a single mother.

"I just watched something that completely changed how I think about ApoE4 and Alzheimer's risk.

For years, we've been told that carrying ApoE4 means one thing: dramatically higher Alzheimer's risk. Period. End of story.

But what if that's only half true?

Dr. Aura Ramirez just presented research that shows ApoE4 behaves COMPLETELY differently depending on your ancestry. Not just ""a little different""—we're talking about fundamental molecular changes in how the gene functions.

Here's what blew my mind:

🧬 **Discovery #1: African ancestry contains a ""genetic brake"" that naturally suppresses ApoE4 expression.** When researchers used CRISPR to remove this brake, ApoE4 expression shot up, but ONLY in African cells. European cells? No change.



🧠 **Discovery #2: In European and African brains, ApoE4 creates a dangerous imbalance:** ramping up cholesterol production while shutting down myelin (the insulation that keeps your neurons firing properly). It's like building more gas stations while letting the highways crumble.



🌎 **Discovery #3: Amerindian brain cells flip the entire script.** Their ApoE4 actually REDUCES cholesterol pathways and INCREASES myelination. Same gene, opposite effect.



**This is both fascinating science AND hope.**

Because if some populations have naturally evolved protection against ApoE4, maybe we can learn to replicate it. Maybe risk isn't as fixed as we thought. Maybe your genes aren't your destiny after all.

I've been diving deep into this research, and just posted a full breakdown on YouTube.

**If you carry ApoE4, or care about someone who does, this might be the most important 15 minutes you spend today. Remember to share it if you believe it might help someone else!**

Because the more we understand about how ancestry shapes genetic risk, the closer we get to truly personalized prevention.

"Hi, I need to make a decision on whether to keep or remove my right kidney+ureter, and the data I have so far is confusing to me (technically every result I have could be explained by inflammatory atypia, but the doctor seems to lean towards it being low-grade cancer). The doctor has recommended I think through my options, so I'm reaching out to this community to get your help (any similar examples, relevant info/research/guidance that could help me decide)

For context, I am a 60year old man who is otherwise healthy and has never had surgery or other major issues in my life. Nobody in my family history has had cancer. I do know many relatives who died after painful periods of dialysis though, hence my sensitivity in deciding whether to remove my kidney or not.

Below is the detailed chronological order of events:

1) My 2025 annual regular check-up identified the following in the ultrasound of my abdomen and chest: ""right gross hydronephrosis with hydroureter (upper) ? right PUJ obstruction"" 
It was recommended I contact a urologist about a kidney stone. I had been told about a small kidney stone in my 2024 annual check-up too but I ignored it and didn't make any lifestyle changes either (I used to not drink much water...)

2) I consulted Urologist #1, who recommended getting DTPA and CT scans. He was quite curt and didn't explain anything, and I got scared about doing a radioactive test so I decided to find another urologist to consult.

3) Meanwhile, I got a CT scan done: ""Gross right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to an enhancing lesion in the proximal ureter - HPE evaluation is suggested. A ureteric calculus at L5-S1 level is also noted. Right renal parenchymal thinning with mild reduced enhancement and delayed excretion - suggesting impaired renal function"". The kidney stone was noted as 1.3 x 0.9cm in size.

4) I also got a Creatinine test done: 1.18mg/dL

5) I consulted Urologist #2 in a separate hospital. He was more junior than the first one though so he seemed to overenthusiastically corroborate Urologist #1's findings and advocated for full right kidney+ureter removal ""just in case"".

6) At this point, I still hadn't found a urologist I felt comfortable with, so I identified Urologist #3 who is both senior and well respected. He was both better at explaining what is going on, and more conservative in approaching the problem, so I started following his advice. We scheduled Surgery #1 to remove the kidney stone, and take a biopsy. He managed to fragment the kidney stone but not entirely, and my ureter is super narrow by birth, so he wasn't able to get his telescoppe instruments up to the affected area to visualize and to biopsy. So we scheduled Surgery #2.

7) Meanwhile, I got a PET-CT scan done: ""Small area of focal high grade FDG uptake seen in circumferential mild enhancing soft tissue lesion in the proximal right ureter (at approx L3-L4 intervertebral level) over a length of 1.8cm and maximum thickness of 0.4cm, SUVmax 11.99. Perilesional prominent stranding in seen having indistinct fat planes with underlying psoas major muscle. Proximal hydroureteronephrosis noted with pelvic APD measuring - 4cm.""

8) We also got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #1: 
For sample 1: ""Smears and cell block show clusters of scattered benign urothelial cells and abundant crystalline material against a clear background. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""
For sample 2: ""Smears and cell block are predominantly hemorrhagic. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""

9) In Surgery #2, Urologist #3 managed to completely powder the kidney stone, and get a visual on the lesion and do the biopsy on the thickened right ureter. He ran an intraoperative biopsy test (Frozen section: cryostat sectioning, staining and microscopy): 
""FSA: focal urothelial hyperplasia with inflammation and atypia (? inflammatory). Final diagnosis on paraffin section.""

10) After the surgery, a second sample was submitted for more detailed biopsy. In this one, the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) done says ""The urothelial cells express CK7, while these are negative for CK20. p53 shows wild type expression."". The findings say ""Tiny tissue fragments are lined by hyperplastic urothelium. Focally the lining epithelium is polypoid and shows increased thickness of more than ten layers. The lining epithelial cells are fairly monotonous with mild nuclear enlargement. No mitotic activity is seen. The underlying edematous lamina propria contains lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The inflammatory cells extend into the overlying urothelium at places. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""
The final pathological diagnosis is listed as:
""A. Biopsy from thickened right ureter, intraoperative consultation: low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive.
B. Upper/mid right ureteric lesion: histomorphology favors a papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""

10) We got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #2: ""Hemorrhagic smears and cell block reveal few coherent and papillaroid clusters of urothelial cells showing mildly pleomorphic hyperchromatic oval to round nuclei with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The background shows few inflammatory cells comprising predominantly of neutrophils along with lymphocytes.
Final pathological diagnosis: cytological features are suggestive of low grade urothelial neoplasm, TPS Category V. A biopsy confirmation is essential.""

10) Urologist #3 interpreted these as being stage 1 transitional cell carcinoma, with the good news being the cancer cells have not penetrated any layers yet. He did recommend doing a DTPA test, and getting a second opinion on the biopsy from one of the best histopathologists around who has 40+ years experience with challenging cases.

11) DTPA result (remember that this was done only 11 days post-operation, so actual numbers may be higher post-recovery): 
""Left kidney: 86.5%, 44.2ml/min. 
Right kidney: 13.5%, 6.9ml/min. 
Total GFR: 51.1ml/min""

12) Second opinion on the biopsy samples:
""Microscopic appearance: The biopsy from the upper right ureter and mid ureter reveals benign polypoidal urothelial mucosa with an edematous stroma. On evaluation with IHC, p53 is not overexpressed and Mib-1 is extremely low & CK20 is negative.
Impression: Biopsy of a thickened right ureter and upper/mid right ureteric lesion: benign polypoidal inflamed urothelial mucosa with inflammatory atypia in the nuclei.""

13) Urologist #3 was completely dismissive of the second opinion for the biopsy. He stated that based on the first biopsy report, urine cytology results from Surgery #2, the visual he had when performing surgery, and the PET-CT report, he is convicted it is cancer and not atypia, and he recommends removing the kidney+ureter entirely. It is ultimately my choice though.","I'm a clinical oncologist, and based on what you’ve described, I’d lean toward removing the kidney and ureter. The PET-CT uptake, the cytology, and surgical visual all point toward low-grade urothelial cancer, even if the biopsy findings are mixed. The right kidney is already contributing very little to your overall function, so removing it likely won’t harm your long-term kidney health. In fact, keeping it might carry more risk down the line – obstruction, infection, or even progression. This isn't a perfect scenario, but given your current function and age, surgery seems like a reasonable and proactive choice.",concur

So far, it all sounds great, right? I’ve been considering moving to be with him but tonight I feel strongly like I should end things. The following issues feel insurmountable to me. 

1.	⁠I have worked very hard to be independent and care for my child alone. I just finished my master’s degree after 3 incredibly difficult years of single parenting, working, and attending school. I’m not sure I’m ready to give up that independence, even if it means continuing to go it alone (which is honestly exhausting, but so is this relationship).
2.	⁠He has a lot of health issues and I am beginning to think he needs a caregiver more than a girlfriend.
3.	⁠We have very different parenting styles. He needs a lot of rest during the day as he struggles to get regular sleep at night. That means he is hands off a lot of the time. (I am not) He also does not discipline in ways I feel are appropriate or effective. His child is unruly, yells a lot, does not use appropriate language with adults and is very impulsive. I know this will create a lot of tension in our relationship if we are unable to agree.
4.	⁠I don’t know his ex well but I already don’t like her. I don’t feel like that’s something I want to deal with for another 10+ years.

"This happened two weeks ago but me and my boyfriend have been bickering about it since and he's been cold with me so I decided to post about it. Throwaway because he has my Reddit account, but he doesn't view this sub. Also sorry for any issues, English isn't my first language

My (22F) parents raised me teaching me domestic skills at a young age, mainly cooking and baking. This wasn't because I was a girl, but it was because my mum thought it was a life skill and she came from a family where both men and women did a lot of cooking. My boyfriend (23M) was raised in a ""fast food house"" and never learned how to cook proper meals because he grew up on takeaway and microwave meals.

We've been together for a year and I count on my hand the amount of times he's actually attempted and made a half-way decent meal. I'm not some 5-star chef, but this grown man doesn't know how to make instant mashed potatoes, cook chicken, make pasta or bake a box of cake mix. He's even terrible when it comes to making foods where the cooking/baking/prep instructions are literally on the back or sides of the packaging.

I've asked him several times to try and learn. Watch a TV show, take a class, read a book about it, hell, even a YouTube or Tiktok video but he refuses to learn how to properly cook anything that's not a basic sandwich (he can't even toast his bread correctly even though I've shown him how to do it in a pan, in the oven and in a toaster)

The other day he tried to make a package of those flavored rice dishes and chicken and he overboiled the water all over our stove (we have a gas stove as well so we had to open all the windows since the flame went out) and managed to char the outside of the chicken and still leaving the inside raw (I still don't know how this was managed). I ended up stepping in and cooking our dinner for us after cleaning the rice water off the stove and scraping char bits off my pan.

He didn't help me cook this second time and when he came to eat I just got a little irritated and said that he needs to learn how to cook at least a few basic meals because I'm tired of always having to cook for him and sometimes clean up after his kitchen disasters.

He said he doesn't understand the big deal about it because I want kids, so that means that I'll be cooking and cleaning up messes constantly anyways. I argued back that it's completely different having to constantly cook for and clean up after a baby or child because they literally can't do it for themselves compared to a grown man who just refuses to learn. I also said that when I have kids I'm teaching all of them life skills like cooking so they won't be helpless and relying on their partner to take care of them like a child when they grow up.

He said I was overreacting and that I won't make a good wife or mother if I complain this much about cooking for people and cleaning up messes. He also called me a hypocrite because admittedly I'm not the most tidy person (he pointed out that my desk and bookshelf is a cluttered mess right now).

I do feel bad for arguing with him over this but I'm tired of having to constantly take care of him like he's a child. He's a grown man who should be able to do this for himself. I also hate how he's making me dislike cooking, because I actually love cooking and cooking for others, but he's just draining the fun out of it and I'm actually considering breaking up with him unless he actually starts showing an effort to learn how to cook, or to at least stop making such a mess with every failed attempt.

"My mom is towards the end of chemo and her veins are really hard to find now. They either drop or get blown. The nurses have to poke around at 4 different locations and even then they keep trying different angles in each spot. It’s been getting worse as chemo goes on. She has 2 cycles left. They have a policy where they have to send her home if they can't insert an IV by the 4th attempt. 

We’ve been considering a port, but with only 2 left, I’m not sure if it makes sense if there's anything else I can do for her. Is there any other option?

I’ve been making sure she’s hydrated and I wrap her arm in a heating pad for an hour before they try the IV. Would massaging her arms help at all? Is there anything else I can do to make this easier on her? Her next infusion is in 2 days. 

Any tips or experiences are appreciated.

"I have been seeing my current boyfriend for nearly 3 months now, dating officially for 1, and we have only gone so far as to makeout. He is a virgin and is extremely sweet and respectful of women, however I know his sex drive is there, he isn't ace, but he doesn't want to have sex with me. We also have known each other for 3-4 years now, him being a regular figure in my household being my brother’s best friend.
I am not a virgin, rather i started having sex at 15 with my first boyfriend due to pressure from him, which naturally evolved into a sexually abusive and manipulative relationship. Similar experience with my second partner. In those relationships i was essentially reduced to my body and what i could offer physically, or how willing/“freaky” i could behave. This led to me developing a hypersexual attitude towards sex and relationships. I didnt know romantic love that didn’t revolve around sex and submission. 

He knows about all that and we have had conversations about my experiences and the resulting sensitivity i feel around rejection and sex as a whole. That isn't to say i don’t respect his rejection. Whenever he stops intimacy, i stop as well and we go back to cuddling as prior. I just want to understand why. I am no longer hypersexual as I used to be but i still retain some of that rejection sensitivity, the ever-recurring affirmation that if he pushes me away or doesn't want to have sex, then Im not what he wants. I’m temporary and he doesnt want to waste his time, or that im too used to want anymore.
He says he thinks im hot (as well as pretty, and all the other green flag words dw), he says it doesnt have to do with religion and he isnt waiting until marriage, but he says things like “..but we arent having sex for a LOONGG time.”

Sometimes it seems like he is serious about me and even thinks he could marry me, but other times i can feel him pulling back or withdrawing like he doesnt want to get too excited or invested in me. Ive had a number of relationships and flings, not all of which were sexual, but he gives me that look all the time, the “I cant enjoy this too much because I know you're just going to find someone better and leave soon. this is temporary” look. That sucks because for the first time ever I actually can see someone being my forever person and not being angry or abusive.
I guess im just worried he thinks im used up or too fragile or not worth losing his virginity to. I dont even want to have sex at this point in the relationship, im just confused why thats not in the cards for in a few months. 
Please give me some perspective on this. Thank you.","So you've been in a sexually abusive relationship twice, and he's your brother's friend, and he's thinking long-term about being in a relationship with you. He's very much probably not wanting to have sex because he wants to make sure that you're having sex because you really want to, Not that you feel that without sex you can't be loved. It kind of sucks, from my friends who I know have been in this situation. Long-term being in a relationship with somebody who's like no, you're not ready to have sex because you aren't there emotionally where you know if we never had sex again, I would love you anyway, is a good thing. That bad sex isn't your fault, and that you don't have to service me only, it's a two way street.

Our plans were canceled once again today by him but at that point i’d realized things were over. i wanted to see him in person but we called and afterwards he took complete accountability. Throughout our relationship he has admitted where he’d hurt me but things never changed and I was stuck trying to figure out whether he couldn’t or he just didn’t want to. He told me he just can’t give me what I need right now, that something has changed within him and that he needs to be honest with himself and confront those feelings to be better in his personal relationships which I respect completely. I just reached a point where after 8 months of all the pain I couldn’t give it anymore time. I’m going off to college in two weeks and I know for long distance even a relationship with a strong basis can face many hardships and ours isn’t at that point. People around me in my family have just been reiterating that college is a time where I will branch out and meet more people but that’s just not who I am. I would not trade in the love I have for someone for the possibility of another, to me being with him is what I want I just.

I feel like if it was any other situation and I wasn’t leaving we would be able to give it time and revisit in the future but we have had so many issues with communication that our issues need to be solved in person and we just don’t have that. He told me accountability without action is nothing and that us being together would just do detriment to us as individuals.

"I am 21F in NYC and in the last 2-3 month I started using cocaine first 1 in a blue moon and then 1-2 x a week now . I am a college student and have an internship this summer/have been fully functional but I am truly terriified about th*e WAY* I think about cocaine.

I worry about addiction but simultaneously compulsively think about it all week and when I go out even on a Tuesday to have a drink with girlfriends, I get so excited in the hours before to go out and snort coke seccretly in the bathroom without telling anyone.

I really want to stop. I am currently writing this in a come down at 5am on a Wed morning and I am seriously struggling. I have just told 2 friends I trust in excruciating detail about how scared I feel to become an addict... I am going to HATE that in the morning... I hate the comedown so so much it makes me regret everything and I feel so truly ashamed the next day until 2-3 days later I am craving it at my summer internship again.

I AM OTHERWISE SUCH A QUAINT UNSUSPECTING GIRL! I just somehow convince myself everybody does it and no one feels guilt about it and no one lets it get out of control / everyone else in Finance does it and is functioning perfectly...

I think I have a multitude of underlying depression/anxiety/ADHD problems that have caused me to become so ""obsessive"" so quickly. This has convinced me that I have deep issues. I hate the person I have become with this. I do not want to be perceived as a ""coke whore"" I want to be NOT that girl so so bad... so I have hid it to every extent possible but I feel so much shame the following day for acting so crazy the night before. I fear some people suspect it anyway.

Just tonight I went out with a group of girlfriends for a casual Tuesday drink and was secretly snorting coke in the bathroom. I LOVED IT :(

I also have a fresh Rhinoplasty 6 months out. I am such a moron??

I just threw my bag out of the window. I hate NYC so much sometimes because it is ALL around me.

I don't know if this qualifies for enough for addiction yet but I know the *WAY* i think about it and worry about it means I am certainly susceptible for this becoming out of control if I do not stop.

I am not the kind of person that can casually do anything I have realized.

PLEASE: PLEASE only leave encouraging comments that will affirm that I should not be doing cocaine and that it is not good for me and that I am able to stop (despite horror stories of years of addiction which almsot confirm that I will never be able to stop?). I haven't been a disciplined person and am super soft genuinely so I could never quit if I was so so addicted I fear. Cocaine may not be a big deal to some people but it is to me and this has become clear tonight for that reason. Please give me tips on how to stop this... I plan to tell my therapist about this but I am so afraid of talking about this to anyone at all. He is also kind of a bad therapist idk.

"Long story short: My boyfriend grabbed my wrists during an argument, pinned me on the bed, and made multiple comments about bruises. I don’t know how to feel about this and I need advice if I’m being dramatic

My 21F boyfriend 20M was arguing and he grab my phone out of my hand and put it in his pocket. For some context this argument was getting bad. He would not let me speak for the two hours we were arguing, he was insulting me, I walked away about 4 times because I cannot communicate with him. The last time I walked away I layed down and went on my phone telling him that I cannot communicate with him right now because he’s insulting me. He grabbed my phone which is not the first time he’s done this in an argument. I asked him a couple times to give it back and he kept saying not unless I’ll listen to him and talk to him. I got up and started reaching for his pocket, I never reached for his body only the pocket with my phone in it and he grabbed both of my wrists aggressively. We spent about 5 minutes of me trying to reach for my phone and him grabbing my arms, moving them, and twisting them to keep me from grabbing my phone. At one point he backed me onto the bed where he was holding me down by my wrists and I had to use my feet to push off his chest. I told him I’ll listen and he gave me my phone back. I don’t remember what he said during our argument after that but I remember being upset and laying back down ignoring him telling him to leave me alone (he has a habit of insulting me and calling me things like dumb, and stupid during arguments). He again grabbed my phone and I got up again trying to reach for it where once again my wrists were in his hands. While this was happening I looked at my wrists and he said “are you looking for a bruise? There’s not one” And “if you keep this up I’m going to bruise you and it’s going to look like I’m abusive” and “are you really struggling and using all of your strength, I’m barely putting in work.” While we were struggling he stepped on our cat and he pushed me by my chest where I had to grab the dresser to stay standing and he blamed me on stepping on the cat. After we made up and went to sleep he said “do you think your dad’s going to shoot me if there’s a bruise?” And “do you think you what I did was abuse?” Where I responded by saying no and falling asleep. I’m writing this at work and I would really appreciate feedback, I’m not sure if I’m being dramatic.

"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on a research project where I’m trying to apply **contrastive learning** to **FreeSurfer-based brain data** (structural MRI features) and **biomarker data** (tabular/clinical). The idea is to learn a shared representation between the two modalities.

The problem: I am **completely lost**.

* I’ve implemented losses like **NT-Xent** and a few others (SupCon, etc.), but I can’t get the approach to work in a meaningful way.
* I’m struggling to figure out the best architecture or training strategy, and I’m honestly not sure what direction to take next.
* There is **no proper supervision in my lab**, and I feel stuck with how to proceed.

I really need guidance from someone experienced in contrastive learning or multimodal representation learning. Ideally, someone who has worked with **medical imaging + tabular/clinical data** before. (So it is not about classical CLIP with Images and Text).

I’m **willing to pay** for mentoring sessions or consulting to get this project on track.

"So, I work from home.  My med change has been making things hard lately, and impacting my performance.   
I preemptively sent my boss an email saying that I had noticed my output had decreased, and I was leaving a lot of things half finished and incomplete without realizing it. I then asked for possible accommodations, listing a few options. The one that I stated I wanted and personally find the most helpful are short daily check ins. 



In the past, when I asked for this, he had stated that I shouldn't need a babysitter-- that needing someone to monitor me is unsuitable.  I don't want to be monitored, I want visible accountability at the end of the day to help trick my brain into getting everything done.  I don't know why it works, but it helps me an incredible amount.  



Today, he tried to have me break down **why** I thought it would do any good.  He really spent a lot of time trying to talk me out of wanting that one, and offered adjusting my schedule instead.  I had included schedule change on the list since before he had recommended that, even though I do my best work in the early morning, and I very much don't want that. I don't know how it would fix anything, but he really wants me to take a later shift. I would be the only one working that late, which seems like the literal opposite of what I need. 

  
After I explained that currently, I would like the check in for a kind of reality check, because I can't trust my judgement, he asked how long I would want, and I said I didn't know, maybe two months if everything went slowly with the meds. He stated this would be an unreasonably long time and burden on someone. 

Is it really such an unreasonable request?  Is there anything else I can do by myself? A strong, consistent check in with repercussions of accountability I don't know how to do alone.

"Yes two questions on the same post. These situations happened to me recently. 

First: I (35F) was in a block party with some friends, my boyfriend didn’t attend because he was travelling. There was this guy from the beer stall who hit on me every time I went to buy beer (only stall at the party), and when the stall closed he came to our group to talk to us and make personal questions about me. My friend’s husband noticed that I was uncomfortable and took the lead on talking to him. I didn’t cut him because I live abroad and can’t really speak the language and he didn’t speak English. The day after my bf came back from the trip, asked me about the block party, how was the music, how was the food, etc. i told him about everything but didn’t mention the guy, even though I was asking myself if I should. Not like a report, but casually, as something that was part of my evening out with my friends. 

Second: I was travelling with a friend this last weekend, in a city 250km away from where we live. I had to go to a store to buy some stuff for the day at the beach, and when I was crossing the street when leaving the store, there was this guy I went on a couple of dates with last year. We were confused because none of us expected to meet there, but we talked briefly, he said he was there for a wedding and invited me for a drink. I said I had plans and we said good bye. Later that evening I was in the phone with my boyfriend and he asked about my day, where we went to, how was the beach, if I liked the city etc. Same thing, I wondered if I should casually mention that I met this guy totally coincidentally and unexpectedly, after one year without seeing him, there, of all places. But decided not to. 

How do you guys deal with these situations? Talk? Not talk? It is not that this has been bothering me, but I am Open to any insights 


TL•DR: I was hit by a guy at a block party and didn’t mention that to my bf when telling him about the evening; then I met a guy I went on a couple dates with while travelling, same thing. Wondered how others [would] deal with that ","Im single now but in relationships I would usually tell. But in the way of it being a sort of funny story, definitely not in the way of ""I need to let you know something serious"". but also I tell because I really want to be in a relationship with a guy who has the kind of security and lack of jealousy where he can hear that story and be like ""haha"" or like ""oh damn I'm sorry that guy was weird to you"". It's just a massive red flag to me if he would respond like, ""well what did you do? Did you talk to him? Did you like him???"" Or like, be shitty or jealous about it. I also lightly am aware of the possibility that it comes up later in a group convo and I think it could look very slightly sketchy if that's the first time he's hearing about it, depending on the seriousness of the moment.",concur
"After 3 yrs of dating and trying to find a partner, I finally met someone who's got most of the internal qualities anyone would want in partner. Kind, empathetic, mature, emotionally aware and the biggest one - calms my nervous system. 

However, he lives in another city, with no solid plan to move near me (my city has more job opportunities and he's been trying to change his job but the economy is horrible). I wasn’t initially considering him as a serious match due to the distance. Ended up meeting him 3 times when he was here, and found it hard to be attracted to him, if I'm being really specific, it was his body type (I hate pointing this one out). I was taken aback since his photos on the profile were old where he was much fit and younger? Every conversation I have over video calls makes me drawn to his personality but I vowed to myself that I will not entertain long distance due to my past ldr relationships. 

Now that I truly like being single, I value quality relationships. Even if I wait and let the attraction grow, I don't foresee it being possible over video calls. Appreciate any thoughts

My surgeon and anesthesiologist have probably only dealt with a single digit number of people with ME/CFS and they’ve probably all been more mild than me so probably didn’t require as many accommodations as me. They’re gonna be thinking “Why does this girl need all this just because she has fatigue?” 

In my chart, despite saying I had “chronic fatigue syndrome”, they only documented POTS and long COVID. Completely erased the ME/CFS aspect. Long COVID as a diagnosis is also terrible since it’s not only controversial and subject to be mocked by covid deniers, but it’s an umbrella term. People think it’s either a loss of smell or lung issues (I’ve had medical staff refer to it as “lung covid”). They’re gonna wonder why that’s relevant in a surgical context. 

The only diagnosis that saves me is POTS, believe it or not. Most of my doctors recognize it as a real condition and due to the effects on the heart and blood vessels, it is taken more seriously in a surgical setting. But again, the name makes it sound so unserious unless you spell it out as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. And it doesn’t help that I’m a young woman so they probably think I’m making my health issues my entire personality to be difficult, and for some reason POTS is one of those conditions associated with malingering. 

Anyways, language matters. These conditions need better names, or at the very least, more awareness highlighting how serious it actually is. ","""Yuppie flu"", originally.",concur
"This is a throwaway. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for over 5 years. She has had multiple previous partners. I have a severe case of retroactive jealousy, even though she's the best possible girlfriend I could ask for.

She was my first and only, which is the main cause of my retroactive jealousy. This is not an excuse, I realize it's my flaw and I don't deny it.

Recently, I snooped through her phone (I'm a terrible person, I know) and went through her messages with her ex. 

I found several explicit videos, all of which clearly showed her face. She was only with this partner for a year or two, and over 5 years with me but she always had a strict no recording rule (which is completely fine with me).

On multiple occasions, she made it clear that we would never record each other doing the deed, and that she has never recorded it in the past with anyone else. This was obviously a lie, and I'm heart broken.

I threw up multiple times and don't know what to do. I love her so much but I honestly can't live like this. It's my fault I looked through her phone, and I don't blame her for having past partners. The thing that hurts the most is that she lied straight to my face. Her ex likely still has the videos. 

I want to own up to it and speak to her but I'm a coward. What do I do?","Maybe her ex is the reason she doesn’t want to do it. Considering your behavior, I can see why she lied. Come clean but you need therapy man. You’re one drunk accident away from destroying your relationship.",oppose
"I (M45) have come out of a long term relationship, 20 years, and have two young kids and work full time, so I’m reasonably busy. I like my work and my kids so don’t need financial or child minding help. I really just want someone to share a bit of my life with once a week (conversation, food, maybe a weekend away or social occasion). Don’t want to re-partner or form a blended family unless everything is perfect, which I view as reasonably unlikely. Happy to be long term, monogamous and generous. I’d like to hear from women if this is enough or do you consider it some sort of red flag? 

I realise a lot of people have stated that once a week is not often enough. I hadn’t really considered frequency and was just using this as an example. My main goal is to retain some autonomy and agency in my life. ","As long as you’re direct about this and let people know early on, there’s no problem. You’re better off looking in the 45+ crowd as that’s when people generally have their lives set and they aren’t as willing to change their lives for a partner anymore. That said, I’m in that 40s bracket and I’m not sure if I would become attached enough to a man who I only see once a week and won’t have future life plans with. I’d need the honeymoon phase and falling in love and the hot sex and all of that to start liking the person enough that I want to keep them in my life.

"I (32F) relocated to my current city 8 years ago for a job opportunity. The place I live now is not somewhere I ever pictured myself living, and certainly not for this long. There are a lot of cultural differences compared to where I grew up, and even after 8 years, I don’t exactly feel like I “fit in”. Making friends has been hard. Dating has been even harder. 

I’ve been single for 3 years, and I’m at the point in my life where I want to find a life partner and settle down. I’d love to have more of a community too. I just don’t see that happening for me where I currently live, and I’ve gotten to the point where I’m seriously considering moving to a new state with hopes of improving my chances. 

I am worried though that maybe it’s not the location, and maybe it’s just me (lol). I’d hate to invest all this time, energy and money into relocating across the country only to find myself in the same spot I’m in now. 

So I’m curious to know, has anyone had a better experience with dating after moving to a new area? 
","I’ve moved around quite a bit, and I’ve definitely had very different dating experiences depending on the city. In places that felt super transient or just didn’t match my vibe culturally, dating was way harder. I struggled to connect with people and didn’t really feel seen. But when I lived in cities that felt more “me”, where the pace, values, and energy aligned better with mine, it was a totally different story. Dating felt easier and more fun, and I met people I actually clicked with. I believe every city has its own personality and attracts certain types of people. That’s why those stereotypes about cities exist - they reflect something real about the collective energy and lifestyle there. So yes, I do think moving could make a big difference for you. It’s not just about location, of course, but being somewhere that resonates with who you are can help you find people who feel like a better fit.

"I feel like an awful person, and I feel an insane amount of guilt right now. 

When my mum told me and my younger sister we were going to London I was SO excited. We were going to see a show! 

I imagined London as seeing big Ben, houses of Parliament, etc. 

We were only staying for one night, so we didn't really have much time.

The first day was ( mostly) a disaster. 

My card wouldn't work on the underground, and people were queuing behind me and I had a full-on panick attack, and my mum started shouting at me. 

When we got to the show, it was AMAZING, but I had another attack on the tube back because it was so busy and crowded. 

On the first full day there, we went to the British museum. That's fine. Museums aren't really my thing, but I tried to be interested. 

We didn't see the whole museum, as we would miss the train going home. 

My mum knew how much I hated the tube, so we started to walk back to the hotel to get the bags and then walk back. ( I didn't know we were walking because of me. My mum just got out Google Maps, and we started walking)

It then started to rain really badly and we were stuck in the rain. 

We got to the hotel, my mum started SCREAMING at me in the hotel lobby saying I "" ruined this trip"" and "" I don't know why I bother taking you places"" and "" you clearly aren't interested In museums"" 

We didn't even get to see Big ben or the House of Parliament because we were at the other side of London and didn't have time. ( which, again, I didn't know that we were at the opposite side of London, so I didn't know that we weren't going to have time)

My mum eventually apologised and said she was just stressed, as we've never been to London before, but I now am currently crying in bed now that were back home because I feel like I ruined the trip. 

My mum is a single mum and has worked so hard for this trip, and I feel I ruined it.

A close friend of mine just found out he has colorectal cancer. He’s avoided going to the Dr for years in general but thankfully his wife sent him this time when he wasn’t feeling well and they found it. Thankfully it hasn’t spread, but he will need surgery. I feel so sad for him, his kids, his poor wife who just recently had a spat with breast cancer. He goes for surgery in a couple weeks and then will be out for about 6-8 weeks recovering. He’s taking it really well though and is thankful for the Dr finding it and his wife making him go. I was originally tipped off about it by his older brother with a promise not to say anything until I was told directly. An hour later is when I got the call. In typical fashion though, he didn’t want to focus on the topic beyond the basic “this is what’s going on and this is what I’m doing”, instead he wanted to quickly change the subject and focus the conversation on my [recent split with the girl I was seeing for 2.5 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/s/qYUNouVCDs). I have seen him physically in a while so I hadn’t kept him up to date on the situation and he was surprised that the split happened. I explained that she just wasn’t sure a relationship was what she needed or wanted right now as when things got real, she got spooked and found she wasn’t happy in almost all aspects of her life and felt dating would be a distraction. He said he felt bad for me to which I replied “Uh…..well ya it sucks but you have cancer?!?!!” So anyways, I’m glad it’s getting taken care of but man, at 31 I’m already sick of hospitals, lawyers and cancer.

"Long version: Been married for 18 years, have 3 bio kids together and 1 adult stepson. Marriage has been rocky for a few years now. I realize I've played my part in the state or our marriage (never cheated, and never even so much as raised my voice to her). I've been deployed for 7 months and have 2 left to go. She was not happy at all about me going on deployment. I found out about 3 weeks ago that she has been texting another dude 30+ times a day every single day since March. 

I asked her about this other guy, but I didn't tell her that I know about the volume of texting. The cell phone account is in my name, so I am able to see all of her call and text activity, I just can't see what the contents of the texts are. I was holding off on telling her that I know about the texting, because I feel that I need to see for myself, what they have been texting to each other and I fear that if I tell her, she'll take it to another app and delete all of her texts. Anyway, she said that he was ""just a friend"" that she met at the gym (the memes write themselves) and that there was nothing going on between them, it was just that he was going through a bad divorce, and she was feeling lonely and needed a friend. I'm sure I'll get called dumb, but I don't think there is actually something physical going on. She has taken 2 trips out of town by herself, and it was obvious from the texting that he didn't go with her because they were texting just as much, if not more than when she was home, especially in the evening.

We talked, I'm not sure how productive it was, because it was primarily me confessing to being a shitty husband for my lack of communication that has led us to the point that we're at. And I do take responsibility for my part in this, but I feel like she has taken zero accountability for the things that she's also done to push me away. And when I told her that I wanted to try and repair our relationship when I return and that I was willing to do whatever it took, she was very noncommittal.

This is of course giving me a tremendous amount of anxiety. I've talked with a couple of close friends about this here, so I am getting some support.

So, I'm just not sure if I should even bother trying at this point. If I do find out that she was having a physical affair, or they were sexting each other, it will be a complete deal breaker for me. But if their texting doesn't rise to that level, I'm willing to work things out. I just get the sense from her, that she just doesn't care about me anymore.

It’s often questions about such irrelevant things that really make no difference and he doesn’t need to know the answers to them. I just get frustrated from having to explain him everything and I don’t know if it’s normal or I’m just being a bitch. 

For example, I would say that I will text him later because I need to save my phone data while being outside.

What makes me want to cry isn’t just that it felt so good and I realized what I’ve been missing out on, but the fact that letting someone that close makes them see the worst of me and it’s just not lovable and makes people not feel good so they associate me with bad feelings that they don’t want to be around.

Piaget is based on Qwen3 and was finetuned on a subset of open reasoning traces from [Dolphin R1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-r1) and [General Reasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GeneralReasoning/GeneralThought-430K).

Available sizes are: [0.6B](https://huggingface.co/gustavecortal/Piaget-0.6B), [1.7B](https://huggingface.co/gustavecortal/Piaget-1.7B), [4B](https://huggingface.co/gustavecortal/Piaget-4B), [8B](https://huggingface.co/gustavecortal/Piaget-8B).

Piaget was inspired by my position paper on emotion analysis: [Improving Language Models for Emotion Analysis: Insights from Cognitive Science](https://aclanthology.org/2024.cmcl-1.23/)

"I hate living with people but life is so expensive. 


With bills pilling up, not making much at my job, frequently having to pull 16 hour shifts to barely make ends meet and an $800 electric bill from the electricity spiking in the winter despite never being home, I decided to get a roommate. An older lady from my job whom I loved dearly who I saw struggling to pay a $1700 rent on her own in a roach infested motel room. To take heat off of me and her, I let her rent a room from me for $800 , everything included, plus her own bathroom and free food since I love to cook and often make way too much food since im used to cooking for a family of 11.


Fast forward 6 months later and I need to kick her out, but the idea of sleeping an average of only 5 hours, working 16 hour days, waking up early in my off days to donate plasma and paying for everything on my own again and still falling behind is literally making me sick. But I cant stomach the idea of another roommate. Ive alreasy had two and they were horrendous, and I really cant stand living with other people.

I’ve lost weight recently, but somehow my boobs look even bigger on my frame now. My bum sticks out too. Whenever I go places, guys stare  even when I’m fully covered, even in baggy clothing. Everything still “shows.” I feel like I look sexual even when I’m trying my hardest not to.

High school sweethearts from 2011 until now. So, 14 years together, married 7. He was my first kiss, my first everything. I was his first… everything other than kiss. (He only kissed 1-2 girls before me, nothing more)

We have 2 beautiful daughters now. They are 2, and 9mo. 

We have great communication skills and have gotten through pretty much every problem we’ve ever had, with no big fights. 

He’s pretty perfect. Doesn’t watch 🌽 or look at females online, helps with kids and house and cooking (as he’s supposed to), works hard for our family. 

His only faults really are that he’s on his phone A LOT and plays video games most nights until 2am. 

But I can’t shake this feeling that it’s all too good to be true. 

I’ve already talked to him about this. He assures me he’s not like other guys, our relationship is special, and I’m the only one for him. Ever. Period.

I’m going through a big period of insecurity atm with being Postpartum 2 kids in 2 years. I think social media is making me feel ugly and insecure as well. Reading Reddit cheating stories probably doesn’t help. But I also don’t want to live with rose-colored glasses on.

I had a first date with a woman I met on Saturday and we made tentative plans for a second date next week. She's an introvert and doesn't seem to be huge on texting. She's active on the dating apps and I want to make sure I stand out from the others, to build a connection. I am interested in hey after all. So what are some things I can text her with until I see her again? 

I realize I either didn't learn much about her, or I forgot half the things she told me on Saturday and that's on me. I'm going to keep notes from now on so this specific situation won't happen again. The reason I want to keep a note is because a friend of mine has bad memory like me and when he was meeting different girls for the first couple dates, it's hard to remember everything so it's better to write things down and not mix one person up with another.","If you didn't let her know you had a good time, reiterate your interest in a second date, etc., then definitely do that.

"I researched prion disease contagion mechanisms in the early 90's. More and more research is classifying Alzheimers as a prion disease (mis-conformations of natural proteins that the body cannot digest). Mad-cow disease (BSE) is a prion disease heavily linked to the similar human diseases such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). Bottom line is that these prion diseases are known to be contagious to humans, primarily by ingesting parts of a prion diseased animal. **I believe that this could also happen from getting the blood of a prion diseased human into an open wound of another. I also suspect that if someone is an IV drug user, and share needles with someone who has, or later develops Alzheimers, then they are at risk as well.**

"Ranting for a minute. 

I am so bloody tired of people acting like I haven't tried to get help before this, like I've just sat back and twiddled my thumbs for years, while the world fell apart around me. 

I have tried for decades to get serious help. I have been to Area Agency on Aging. I have been to various government agencies. I have asked for cleaning help, with transportation and so on.  I have tempted and worked full and part time.  I've been active in the community.  

My parents went for clean enough to be functional their entire lives.  I've worked out a cleaning schedule and then fallen off it for whatever reasons since I first learned about Sidetracked Home Executives, way back when.

Mostly I was told not that I couldn't do anything because I didn't own the house. Or that I had to wait until they didn't care, like with Dad's Parkinsons. It never got to that stage. Or cleaning - either the above, or we can't get you help until you fix this - well, Dad refused to ""fix this"" (one of the few times I was absolutely livid with my Father). I tried, but failed. It wasn't until after he passed that I learned it wasn't a drywall problem, and that then has led on a trail of several places who have said they'd fix it, and each then ghosted us. The last guy scammed us out of $7k and basically disappeared.  I've been  stuck in a circle trying to track him down.  One place sayd check here. That place sends me back to the first place. 

Same for the other problems.  We practically had the car rebuilt last year, several things broke throughout the year. 

Could I have done better? Of course.  Hindsight is always 20/20. I've made mistakes; I'm not going to lie. I'm not perfect. But damn it, I have tried to get help for a very bloody blessed long time. Shaming me or anyone else is not frigging helpful!

Some of you seem to think I should have chucked my parents in a nursing or old age home and forgot about them. That's not who I am. I've seen that done; Mom had a rest home ministry for years. My Grandma spent years in the resg home. Again, when I checked into it, we needed to sell the 2nd house, at least five years from before when they would go into the home. Again, that has not been an option until this year. 

Of course if I could go back in time, I would. I'd make changes. But Dr. Who doesn't really exist, and that's not possible.

Now I do this constantly. ""I don't know the exact timeline, but I'll find out."" ""Let me confirm those benefits details with HR."" ""That's outside my expertise, but I know who to ask.""

My response time is sometimes longer, but my accuracy is way better. Candidates trust me more because they know when I do give them information, it's reliable. Hiring managers respect that I'm not just making stuff up to sound knowledgeable.

The weird part is, I thought this would make me look incompetent. Instead, it made me look more professional. Turns out people value honesty and thoroughness over quick answers that might be wrong.

This works in personal life too. Instead of nodding along when friends talk about topics I don't understand, I ask questions. People love explaining things they're passionate about.

What's something you stopped pretending to know that actually made you better at what you do?","This is true in most fields, even the ones where you might think it's unacceptable. When someone with a hard to treat illness sees a doctor who admits, ""I'm not sure how I can help, but I'm going to do some research and get back to you."" That's the doctor you trust. The doctor who already 'knows everything' and is confident they can help - they will be the ones to blame you if you don't respond to treatment, because they certainly can never be wrong or at a loss. I don't know…but I'm going to do my best to find out is incredibly powerful.",concur

"Hi,

I haven’t posted on here since last year, but my prognosis has gotten much worse and I was just told today that I’m officially out of options. So I’d like to just vent a little bit. 

The tumors grew so much these past two weeks that they caused a pericardial effusion, and my oncologist said I’ve reached the end of the road. I can try more chemo, or I can live out however long I have left just managing my symptoms until I eventually stop breathing or my heart stops beating. I’m not scared of death, but I am sad that I’ll leave my loved ones behind and there’ll be stuff I miss out on. I have such bad FOMO especially since treatment has kept me from being at so many events and doing normal young adult things. It’s really annoying to have to make this choice. 

I don’t know what to do, I’m leaning on stopping treatment but I’m scared of the pain that might come from that. This sucks. But I’m also tired of constantly suffering only to keep getting sicker, so maybe it’s a good thing. It’s just very demoralizing to hear that you’re going to die and there’s nothing anyone can do to help you. ","I’m in the same position. I have less than a year left, maybe as little as 3 months. I’m not doing any more treatment because it will only prolong my life by a few months, but it will drop my blood counts to zero and I don’t want to be isolated in effort to avoid catching some illness. I’m choosing quality over quantity. I’m also 52f, and although 52 is still on the young side, I’m at a good stopping place. I’m single, and I’ve raised my son to adulthood. I’ve experienced a lot, and I’m glad that I won’t have to die alone when I’m elderly or watch my loved ones precede me in death. I’ve known that I’m out of options for the past 3 months now, and I’ve come to terms with it. I quit my job and I’ve got plenty of savings to allow me to do whatever I want. I’ve been spending my time making sure my estate is in order, seeing various close friends or family 3-4x a week, throwing myself a “death party” at a venue with an open bar/open mic to see all of my people including acquaintances and distant family (it was a really fun party and had a great turnout!), eating/drinking anything I want - now I can drink alcohol after being sober through my entire treatment. I also had a lot of food restrictions that I’ve thrown out the window. When I’m home alone, I enjoy myself with weed edibles and sink into a good movie with my cat on my lap. Knowing my death is around the corner has given me a lot of freedom and peace. I see freedom in the ability to break all of my own rules within reason. I’m at peace because I no longer feel fear over our toxic politics in the US, the scary future of AI, or climate change (though I still recycle as much as I can). This news is really fresh for you and it’ll take some time to get past the feeling of denial and/or depression. I’m sorry you’re experiencing this. It really puts everything into perspective, doesn’t it? Please try to surround yourself with loved ones. I find it to be most comforting and the best use of my time. Feel free to DM me if you want or need to vent/chat/whatever. Edit: when I mentioned I feel freedom to break my own rules, I meant that I sleep in until noon, let my house get messy, watch as many terrible movies as I please while eating an entire pint of ice cream. That kind of stuff.",concur
"I recently graduated from university and got my BS in Biology. I was on the Pre-Medical track, but to be honest I wanted to be a doctor because I'd make money and it sounded prestigious for my modest family. Now that I'm done I'm burnt out, barely made the GPA for the pre-med program, not nearly high enough for MD school, so I've got a useless degree.

I don't really want to stay in the healthcare field because anything even adjacent to being a physician means more time wasted in school and more money spent on tuition. I really I want to start making money now and be able to grow my income, I know that's such a vague goal but I just want financial stability and a high ceiling for growth. My main concern is that I lack the skills that would be necessary for a career like this and I've already spent so much money, time and effort into biology.","Go be a biotech somewhere or quality control analyst. Degree helps but not necessarily required, really good pay, decent job security, opportunity for growth, etc. Depending on the department your skills will range from semi-relevant to very useful. Biotech day-to-day job is very hands-on and is stimulating enough to make days feel like they don't drag, while QC will be more specific lab skills but is more of a balance between desk work and lab work depending on your sub-classification. No further education needed and even starting pay is good. Many of the companies will even offer tuition reimbursement if you decide to pursue a masters or PhD later Edit: As far as lacking skills, you'd be surprised who they actually train as biotechs. With a degree you'd be starting with a leg up and would help with promotions, but the job itself is not a whole lot different than normal manufacturing jobs with the exception it's not as monotonous imo",concur

"This happened two weeks ago but me and my boyfriend have been bickering about it since and he's been cold with me so I decided to post about it. Throwaway because he has my Reddit account, but he doesn't view this sub. Also sorry for any issues, English isn't my first language

My (22F) parents raised me teaching me domestic skills at a young age, mainly cooking and baking. This wasn't because I was a girl, but it was because my mum thought it was a life skill and she came from a family where both men and women did a lot of cooking. My boyfriend (23M) was raised in a ""fast food house"" and never learned how to cook proper meals because he grew up on takeaway and microwave meals.

We've been together for a year and I count on my hand the amount of times he's actually attempted and made a half-way decent meal. I'm not some 5-star chef, but this grown man doesn't know how to make instant mashed potatoes, cook chicken, make pasta or bake a box of cake mix. He's even terrible when it comes to making foods where the cooking/baking/prep instructions are literally on the back or sides of the packaging.

I've asked him several times to try and learn. Watch a TV show, take a class, read a book about it, hell, even a YouTube or Tiktok video but he refuses to learn how to properly cook anything that's not a basic sandwich (he can't even toast his bread correctly even though I've shown him how to do it in a pan, in the oven and in a toaster)

The other day he tried to make a package of those flavored rice dishes and chicken and he overboiled the water all over our stove (we have a gas stove as well so we had to open all the windows since the flame went out) and managed to char the outside of the chicken and still leaving the inside raw (I still don't know how this was managed). I ended up stepping in and cooking our dinner for us after cleaning the rice water off the stove and scraping char bits off my pan.

He didn't help me cook this second time and when he came to eat I just got a little irritated and said that he needs to learn how to cook at least a few basic meals because I'm tired of always having to cook for him and sometimes clean up after his kitchen disasters.

He said he doesn't understand the big deal about it because I want kids, so that means that I'll be cooking and cleaning up messes constantly anyways. I argued back that it's completely different having to constantly cook for and clean up after a baby or child because they literally can't do it for themselves compared to a grown man who just refuses to learn. I also said that when I have kids I'm teaching all of them life skills like cooking so they won't be helpless and relying on their partner to take care of them like a child when they grow up.

He said I was overreacting and that I won't make a good wife or mother if I complain this much about cooking for people and cleaning up messes. He also called me a hypocrite because admittedly I'm not the most tidy person (he pointed out that my desk and bookshelf is a cluttered mess right now).

I do feel bad for arguing with him over this but I'm tired of having to constantly take care of him like he's a child. He's a grown man who should be able to do this for himself. I also hate how he's making me dislike cooking, because I actually love cooking and cooking for others, but he's just draining the fun out of it and I'm actually considering breaking up with him unless he actually starts showing an effort to learn how to cook, or to at least stop making such a mess with every failed attempt.

"I created an algorithm that cleans pixel-art-style images such as those produced by generative model, or low-quality web uploads of sprites, to true resolution assets.

Generally the raw output of pixel-art-style images is generally unusable as an asset due to

* High noise
* High resolution
* Inconsistent grid spacing
* Random artifacts

Due to these issues, regular down-sampling techniques do not work, and the only options are to either use a down-sampling method that does not produce a result that is faithful to the original image, or manually recreate the art pixel by pixel.

Additionally, these issues make them very difficult to edit and fine-tune.

I created an algorithm that solves these issues and outputs usable sprites.

They don't even really have to be all that non-romantic. I view a future cohabitation agreement as sort of saying ""we love each other, we want to treat each other right and respect each other, and we should write that down now while we're both on the same page with good intentions"". It can be as simple as you both walk away with what you came in with, or how you split pets, etc., but having that written down can really help. You just don't know who you'll both be in five years. Otherwise, at our age and point in life changing living situations is as good a time as any to revisit your will if you have one, and potentially updating information like health insurance etc. Hopefully you've had some trials days/weeks together beforehand and know what to expect!

TLDR: I have a benign bronchial duplication cyst that makes me wonder if my LC is actually just symptoms of this chest mass and I’m being deceived into thinking I have long COVID be bad doctors. Also had my 16th er visit the other day. 


I’m sure that what everyone here is experiencing is happening, so I don’t mean “oh it’s all in our heads” or whatever. But for me personally I have another issue that makes me doubt if I’m suffering from LC or not. During my first ER appointment they found a noticeable mass in my chest which has been pretty well investigated. It’s a congenital bronchial duplication “cyst.”The thoracic surgeon told me they don’t usually cause the issues I am experiencing, like vision problems and cognitive issues- however they do causes swallowing problems and shortness of breath, chest pressure, that sort of thing. So half of my problems at least could be related to that, and in rare cases maybe even the neuro stuff!! But it’s also rare for these things to even cause noticeable symptoms at all, so I have no way of knowing. 

I would say 80% of doctors I see have never heard of long COVID so when I see someone new they bring up the chest mass and then I start wondering all over again if my problems really are all from this mass and I’m just deluding myself about the long COVID. The rest of the time if people do think it’s COVID I get nothing out of it.

I went to the ER for the sixteenth time in 2 years the other night… I’ve been 16 times for real. It was like 1am and I had been woken up with terrible left sided weird issues again and felt like maybe I was having some cardiac problem. Just awful. Numb, suffocating chest neck left arm, sob, the usual, but worse. The doctor who saw me was good, and she insisted I needed a primary to really be keeping up with me, and told me to be aggressive. She questioned me about the chest mass and refered my cardio thoracic surgery.

I’m just so tired of this. It took me 5 month to even get scheduled with cardiology and it will be another 2 months to get seen. I made 30 phone calls trying to get scheduled. I even sent them the damn ekg they “maybe” needed myself and they never could access it. I’m not sure how to be MORE aggressive, and at this point I hate myself for even being polite anymore. I was never a pushy or demanding person, but now it’s like the fact that I’m not a raging entitled asshole is working against me because the medical system is so bad. 

Having all this uncertainty for 2 years is so draining. Is it the chest cyst? Is it just LC because it has all those symptoms too but you’ll never know because you can’t test for it?? Is it BOTH? What if I end up getting surgery to have it removed and it solves NOTHING and then I have to heal from chest surgery and have long COVID. What if I never even had long COVID and they were wrong about this cyst and it’s pressing on my nerves and that’s why I can’t use my hands properly anymore when I’m upright. 

The cognitive haze is just horrible. The number one thing that makes me think I’m dealing with LC is the brain fog, because no one else is describing it like the people on here who have it. 

I don’t know why I’m even writing this. I know nobody here has an answer either, and everyone is suffering. I just really hope I get some sort of solid answers soon because life where every single one of your senses and activities is impacted is really the final test of endurance",Yeah it would be really unfortunate but not impossible,concur

"So, I'll try to safe you the whole 'woe is me' story, but some details are important. 

>Due to some trauma related mental health issues, as well as my upbringing leaving out a big chunk of the social spectrum (I believe my dad has pretty low EQ, and my mum has hella issues), dating has always felt like lifting above my weight. What didn't help was that around the time I started liking girls, my self-esteem was at an all time low, and being bullied a lot, I didn't really dare to tell someone I liked them. This I eventually overcame (in the most awkwardly adorable way), but it did set the tone for my dating experience trough-out my 20's. Long story short; there where some really nice, but mostly awful experiences, and a lot of 'what's wrong wit me'-flavored loneliness. A couple years ago I took a break from dating to do some mental health work, something I'm still working on, although I'm proud to boast considerable progress. 

  
I'm excited to return to dating as soon as I feel I'm ready enough to start dating from a constructive place. I feel like I can be a better (more sane) partner, and I feel like I'm (almost) sensible enough to start dating from a place of mutual respect, rather than defeatism and bitterness. I'd really like to break that cycle. and go on dates and feel like it's 2 people getting to know each other, rather than me begging for scraps. I want to make a move on someone and feel like I have half a clue of what I'm doing, maybe even enjoy the chase. Flirt a bit, maybe have a fun fling, maybe not. 

And who knows, maybe fall desperately in love. Although I'm ok if that doesn't happen. I'm no longer looking for someone to save me :) 

Thing is, excited as I am, I have hella cold feet about getting back on that horse. I have some pleasant experiences to guide me, but also 20odd years of fear and loathing looming over my shoulder. On top of that, the current discourse on dating seems so full of stigma these days, that I've struggled to find some genuine support. Even amongst my friends. I'm really not sure where and how to approach finding and going on dates without feeling insecure about the lack of experience I have, or the position in Iife I'm expected to be at. (eg I have no short term interest in planning a happily ever after, especially the one with rings and home-grown poop-monsters).

Anyway, any advice, support, sources or anecdotes would be highly appreciated.

They are pushing hard for me to take SSRI’s / Zoloft. I am only depressed because I am in chronic pain (head vice 24/7). I tried nortriptyline once and it skyrocketed my issues and pain ten-fold. I know it’s a TCA/diff drug class. 

What I’m asking for is PLEASE any research that i can share with them (any articles to send them please!) or self experiences of SSRI’s and how they effected someone with LC. I’ll listen to good or bad. I just feel so unheard. I Understand that my parents don’t understand. But I’M the one doing the research, not them. They hear a doctor wants to throw medication at me and are dumbfounded that I’m not taking it. I’m about to break down. 
 ","If any supplement or medication makes you feel worse, it's probably not the best idea to continue and that should be enough. If it helps even a little, you'd probably take it without being told to. If it's situational depression, I can't say if it will or won't help in the short term, but I'm guessing long term at least there may be issues coming off them?

"I am currently trying to get diagnosed. It's the second time I'm trying this, I wrote a post like 3-5months ago explaining how shitty the first clinic was. 

Today we spoke about maladaptive daydreaming, how stop what I'm doing to do something else, inability to study if it's not the day(hours before) and exam, incapability to start stuff...

I told her that often, I can't start shit even if I like it, I can't start the fourth book of the storm light archive, I can't start playing videogames, I'm trying to learn guitar, but there is no pressure since I'm learning on my own... BUT, sometimes I can focus really hard to the point of my eyes hurting, my knees sore because the have been hours without moving, not sleeping because of videogames/books

She told me ""maybe it's an addiction problem, you do seem to be capable of concentrating on something..."" 

I had to explain to her that I believed that ADHD is a problem of not being able to direct your focus, not the complete lack of it. 
Like, wtf.

Luckily she was open to hear me and told me that we could keep going till the end of summer before a diagnosis since there is no hurry. 

Plus, she told me that whenever I get distracted I should try to get back on track with grounding techniques. It felt like she was telling me to try harder.

"Alright so I (18F) recently met this super nice guy (22M) on hinge, and we got along super well. We went on a date to his apartment (ifywim), and both of us had long term in our dating profiles, and had discussed our want for a serious relationship.

One of the small details here is that I had hung out with my friend (18M), who is gay, and this guy had kind of gotten quiet after this. Not as flirtatious, responding later, etc. He also had mentioned he had been cheated on in his last relationship, but this was in October.

Now, after me talking to and hanging with my friend, he had gotten super quiet and not returning my energy, so I had asked him if he was doing okay. He said he ""couldn't give me what I was asking for"", and he had ghosted me for about 6 days. 

I was very distraught about this, I really liked him and I was under the impression he liked me to. There wasn't any big red flags that showed he didn't like me, and he genuinely had all the qualities I like in a man (nerdy, super sweet, funny, likes to build things, etc). After the 6 days, he texted me just saying he wanted to take things super slow.

He also explained that around his birthday, he tends to get quiet and he tends to just shut down for personal reasons, which is understandable. Don't blame him for it at all.

We talked for about another 1-1.5 weeks, and I began to have a lot going on. I tend to also tell people ""Hey, i'm not feeling to good, i'm just going to go to bed"", when I'm really riled up, and I told him this one night after a rough day and him not responding for a while.

Now, in the 1-1.5 weeks, he was normal for the first part. However, the last two/three days he began to shut down more, and he wouldn't flirt back or wouldn't fully return energy, but he didn't mention him having a super rough time. However, it was still around his birthday.

He was super nice, sending me long voice messages, all of that super fun stuff. I didn't really get any signs he wasn't into me or anything

Since my last text, he hasn't texted me back. It's been about 2.5 weeks, and i'm more conserned now. I really don't think he's the type to fully ghost someone, and I'm more concerned something happened to him. He hasn't been active anywhere (instagram, spotify, etc).

Him and I have talked about how much we hate when people ghost before, and he does just seem like the person who wouldn't ghost me, leading to my confusion and concern. 

I'm thinking of dming him on instagram, because I haven't dm'd him there, and seeing if he replys. He's also had situations of him losing his phone and having to get a new one before. He doesn't have read reciepts, so if I dm'd him on insta, i'd at least be able to see if he read it.

What do you guys think? Is this too stalkery, or am I okay in my concerns here?",I saw your other post about this. And girl you need to move on. Dude needs therapy…bad!!! Also for the ghosting just so we’re clear I think he’s in the wrong for that. It’s just someone people they will say something similar to what he said and count that as communication theyre gonna dip. This dude has a ton of red flags but you aren’t picking up on them. Which isn’t completely your fault. I dated someone with a similar age gap around your age and I didn’t notice all the red flags either. People that are older tend to know how to hide them or will purposely date someone younger because people their age pick up on the BS. I’m not sayin dude is a predator or anything like that. I’m just saying different places in life when you’re at these ages and sometime people take advantage of that. I promise you relationships are this difficult. You do have to work at them but not from jump like this. There is way more communication. Personally I’d block him and move on. The second someone ghosts you don’t let them back in because it’s shows you will allow them to treat you like this. You shouldn’t have to work this hard to get the bare minimum,concur
"Hi everyone,

As part of my dissertation for my Computer Science degree at Newcastle University, I investigated how to enhance the current state of 3D print failure detection.

Current approaches such as Obico’s “Spaghetti Detective” utilise a vision based machine learning model, trained to only detect spaghetti related defects with a slow throughput on edge devices (<1fps on 2Gb Raspberry Pi 4b), making it not edge deployable, real-time or able to capture a wide plethora of defects. Whilst their model can be inferred locally, it’s expensive to run, using a lot of compute, typically inferred over their paid cloud service which introduces potential privacy concerns. 

My research led to the creation of a new vision-based ML model, focusing on edge deployability so that it could be deployed for free on cheap, local hardware. I used a modified architecture of ShuffleNetv2 backbone encoding images for a Prototypical Network to ensure it can run in real-time with minimal hardware requirements (averaging 15FPS on the same 2Gb Raspberry Pi, a >40x improvement over Obico’s model). My benchmarks also indicate enhanced precision with an averaged 2x improvement in precision and recall over Spaghetti Detective.

My model is completely free to use, open-source, private, deployable anywhere and outperforms current approaches. To utilise it I have created PrintGuard, an easily installable PyPi Python package providing a web interface for monitoring multiple different printers, receiving real-time defect notifications on mobile and desktop through web push notifications, and the ability to link printers through services like Octoprint for optional automatic print pausing or cancellation, requiring <1Gb of RAM to operate. A simple setup process also guides you through how to setup the application for local or external access, utilising free technologies like Cloudflare Tunnels and Ngrok reverse proxies for secure remote access for long prints you may not be at home for. 

Whilst feature rich, the package is currently in beta and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Please use the below links to find out more. Let's keep failure detection open-source, local and accessible for all!

"As you can read from the title, I’ve just finished up my 14th cycle of chemo after recurrence back in November last year. I have done 28 days of radiation and did a pet scan this week so that my doctors can discuss a possible surgery to my spine. It has been a very hard year, and I’m so glad it’s over. However, it’s hitting me in ways that I didn’t expect. 

On my first cycle, I stayed overnight in hospital and I ended up sharing a room with someone who was my age and we both had Ewings. We immediately connected, shared contact info and the rest was history. She was on her first cycle also, so it felt as though we were fighting this thing together as a team. We would share stories about what our days or weeks had been like, any funny stories while we were in the oncology ward, always making sure to visit each others rooms if we were in the ward at the same time. As someone who has had Ewings before, I was able to answer any and all questions she’d have about treatment and hopefully alleviate her anxiety - of which she had a lot. So yeah, we were fighting this thing together and although I would never wish this on anyone, I was glad to have her by my side through this fight. I considered her a very good friend.

Unfortunately, she stopped responding to treatment and passed away around our 10th cycle. I was, and still am, a complete mess. My last 4 cycles of chemo dragged on and felt never ending. Now that it’s finished, I can’t stop crying. I keep thinking about her and how she should be here with me now, celebrating the end of chemo. 

I feel so so exhausted now, everything hit me like a truck now that I’ve finished chemo. Throughout treatment, I kept on working full time, using leave for whenever I was not up for work - typically while I was doing chemo (I wfh for reference). Now that treatment is over, I’m expected to be back at work 40 hours every week and I just don’t know how I can do it. I pushed myself so hard to continue work throughout treatment and now that it’s over I just have to keep going. My ‘prize’ for finishing chemo is more work? I’m scared to leave my job because the job market is so bad right now and I hear stories from everywhere about people not being able to find jobs. I don’t know what to do but I’m not sure I can go on like this. 

Not sure if this sounds entitled but I really don’t want to work, at least right now. I want to go traveling and have new experiences, I feel like I deserve to do this? I might die anyways, I don’t want to be working in my final year of life.

Before anyone asks haha I have a great support system, lots of friends and family and I have a meeting with a psychologist in two weeks. Keen to talk this through with a professional lol.

"Looong read

I M51) haven't had alcohol or weed in years. From late teens to early twenties, I was a weekend binge drinker. Plain old 5% beer. During the week I didn't drink and it never crossed my mind. If for some reason I did not go out on the weekend, then I didn't drink either. Once I stopped going out that was it, no more beer. In my early to mid twenties I tried some weed and fell in love. It was like an amplifier! Music was better, movies were better, it just felt amazing. I quit several times, usually for a few years and for various reasons. I got married about 20 years ago, and everything was great for the first 10 or so years. But after that it declined and I wasn't happy and neither was she, so I started weed again. And that snowballed to the point where I wanted to smoke whenever I had a chance. Drinking was very sporadic until I started hanging out with coworkers after work. I'm ashamed to admit I drove home with a blood alcohol level that was over the limit on more than one occasion. I got a divorce and started seeing someone else; neither went very well. I eventually stopped smoking weed but by doing so, I increased my alcohol intake. I guess I needed something. Beer, IPAs in the 5-8% range, or red wine were my go to. It ended my relationship, I bought a house, kept drinking and restarted weed, and before long work was starting to suffer. So I decided to seek help and have been clean ever since. Like I said I'm 51 now. I can't say I have cravings. Ice cream or pizza sure, weed or alcohol not really. But I so miss the occasions where I'm sitting on the porch with a beer or a a joint (well bowl usually). I thonk it's more the yhought of it than anything else. I know I can never have either again though and that sucks. I have stopped listening to a lot of music and stopped walking a lot of movies because they are just not as exiting withoud weed. I used to be a fervent gamer but apparently not without weed! Crazy really. I've been looking for an alternative to give me a light buzz. Nothing crazy, just enough to enjoy the porch again. I just don't know if something like that exists, or won't get me addicted again. I even thought about hypnotherapy. Not to get rid of these thoughts mind you, but to be able to control the amount I consume.

"I graduated in my degree last year and I have a fully written paper ML as a final in my class that my professor suggested publishing because he was impressed. I held off because I was working full time and taking 2 courses at a time, so I didn't feel like I had time.

He said it just needs tweaks to fit in conferences(when we had first discussions after the course completed). So, I've ignored publishing until now.

As I am now getting ready for interviews for better opportunities, I want to know if it's possible to publish my paper in some manner so that I have it under my belt for my career and that if I post it anywhere, no one can claim it as their own.

Recently we've started a paper reading group:

* ML-inclined folks meet up every few weeks to discuss a pre-agreed-upon paper, which participants (ideally) have skimmed beforehand
* One person leads discussion, get the group on the same page about the paper's findings
* Spend the rest of the hour talking about the paper's possible application across our company's products

* impact ML implementation of existing products
* inspiration for completely new products
* emergent consensus on what we should be reading next

* **Have you tried this at your company?** How long did it last? How do you guys operate it?

"My(40m) fiancé (44f) and I have been together for 3 years and engaged for 6 months. I work a job where I never spent more than two years in a place before I’d get sent somewhere else in the country. 

We moved in together about 3 months ago. 

I knew her son was a bit unmotivated but I didn’t quite understand the extent of it. He works part time and spends all his money on marijuana. 

He spent all of age 18 in her basement doing nothing. Fiancé would regularly give him weed money whenever he asked. I’d tell her she needs to stop doing that and she’d reply with “I know I know” but it never stopped. 

He finally got a job. Yay. 
He lives in the basement, pays no rent, doesn’t pay for his phone bill, doesn’t pay for his car insurance. She does. He doesn’t do any dishes, clean his bathroom or the basement, cook, grocery shop, or do yard work. WE do. 

He went around to different neighborhoods and literally went through peoples trash looking for things to sell. Where did those things end up? The garage. After my fiancé asked him numerous times to get that shit out we just did it ourselves. 

We spent a few weekends cleaning out the garage only to walk in there one day to find a pile of tarps that he says cats had peed on. He says he’s going to clean them off and fold them neatly this weekend. We’ll see. 

Fiancé still makes his doctor appointments, gives him money, and is absolutely terrified of making him upset. 

She started crying one day because she thought she had upset him. I told her that if her kid is never upset with her then she’s not parenting properly. 

Everything that happens revolves around making sure he is content and happy and not inconvenienced. 

I’ve told her that she has some codependency issues that really need to be addressed and that she is hurting any chances this dude has at being a productive adult but it falls on deaf ears.

I was holding off on telling her that I know about the texting, because I feel that I need to see for myself, what they have been texting to each other and I fear that if I tell her, she'll take it to another app and delete all of her texts. Anyway, she said that he was ""just a friend"" that she met at the gym (the memes write themselves) and that there was nothing going on between them, it was just that he was going through a bad divorce, and she was feeling lonely and needed a friend. I'm sure I'll get called dumb, but I don't think there is actually something physical going on. She has taken 2 trips out of town by herself, and it was obvious from the texting that he didn't go with her because they were texting just as much, if not more than when she was home, especially in the evening.

We talked, I'm not sure how productive it was, because it was primarily me confessing to being a shitty husband for my lack of communication that has led us to the point that we're at. And I do take responsibility for my part in this, but I feel like she has taken zero accountability for the things that she's also done to push me away. And when I told her that I wanted to try and repair our relationship when I return and that I was willing to do whatever it took, she was very noncommittal.

This is of course giving me a tremendous amount of anxiety. I've talked with a couple of close friends about this here, so I am getting some support.

So, I'm just not sure if I should even bother trying at this point. If I do find out that she was having a physical affair, or they were sexting each other, it will be a complete deal breaker for me. But if their texting doesn't rise to that level, I'm willing to work things out. I just get the sense from her, that she just doesn't care about me anymore.

As the title says, is this relationship salvageable? And what can I do to bring her around?",even if she ain’t getting her back blown out (which she is) you still gotta end this shit,concur
"Hello!

My husband and I have been living with my Grandfather for the past year. He's in a place with the disease where he really cannot live on his own, but he is adamantly resistant to moving from his home.

My husband and I are self employed, so it was easier for us then it would be for any other family members to care for him (admittedly it's been more of an undertaking than we thought it would be, but I was mentally prepared for that to be the case.)

What I need help with is this - although either myself or my husband can be home 99% of the time, there are occasions (even as simple as going for a long walk together outside) when we are not both there. He has gotten to a point where he will sometimes leave the stove/burner on, and I'm quite concerned about him starting a fire. We of course have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in the kitchen, but I'm trying to figure out a system where I can get a push notification to my phone if an alarm is triggered in the home, but everything I'm finding is a much more complicated system then I want to set up.

I also don't want it to be some huge thing that is really noticeable to him, because any ""new"" item he's likely to throw away because he doesn't know what it is.

I know this may be more of a tech question then an Alzheimer's question, but I thought some folks here may have tried things that worked for them in similar situations! Any help/advice is much appreciated.",Maybe you could put a camera focused on the stove so you can see the feed on your phone.

"I've been out of the dating game for 3+ years due to a health issue. I'd like to get back soon. Before that, I was almost exclusively trying to meet women through the apps. I definitely struggle with viewing women as wanting to be left alone almost all of the time in every scenario. I consider myself a socially-adjusted guy, I have plenty of friends, hobbies, a home, I'm well-groomed and in decent shape... not bragging about this, just giving a baseline so everyone's aware I'm not an isolated weirdo wearing unwashed sweatpants and an Anime t-shirt, living at home with mom.

But every time I'm out and see someone I'm attracted to, I can't push myself to go say hi. And I'm not talking walking up to someone on the street on the way to work, but even in shared, relaxed situations, like a concert, bar, or park. It's especially bad if it's in a male-dominated event like a comic-con or a sporting event, because I assume I'll just be guy #108 ruining their time out.

What's eating at me today is that I was playing Pokemon Go in the park this morning with a bunch of people for an event. A woman just my type, appropriate age range, also there by herself with her dog, was hanging out and playing. To make a long story short, looking for one in-game thing, we ended up reasonably by ourselves in a nice shaded area, just hanging out. For at least half an hour.

I didn't say a damn word to her. We had a shared hobby, I could have asked to pet her dog, asked her if she was having any luck catching Pokemon, anything. I just froze and concentrated on the game, and even when she walked off to catch a Pokemon I was about to walk to, I sat there and waited because I worried she'd think I was following her. And I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable just enjoying her hobby and fresh air.

I just froze because I didn't want to ruin her day. I guess my question here is... was that an appropriate place to get to chatting with her? Would I have ruined her day or scared her as a single woman in the park? Should I have talked to her? What should I have said?

I used to be decent with women in my teens and 20s but I've definitely gotten more worried about how they're going to feel, and the apps feel so much safer because I already know there's some mutual interest. Thanks in advance for any advice.","Yeah you should have chatted with her! Just be friendly and if a vibe develops, then see it through. I’m 34F and have recently tried being open to being approached and approaching men. When I made that mindset shift, it happened 3 times in just over a week! 1) I was walking near a museum and a guy was taking selfies of himself (poorly). I asked if he wanted me to take his picture. He was excited and said yes. We chatted for a bit, walked around, and he asked me out. 2) I went to a dance class followed by a social dance. I danced with a specific guy quite a few times and we had amazing chemistry and a lot of fun. He had my number by the end of the night. 3) I went up to the rooftop bar at a hostel soon after arriving to take in the view. A guy complimented my tattoo, so I casually chatted with him and the other guy sitting with him. I said I needed to go get some dinner, he asked if he could join. We each paid for our own dinner, but then that turned into bar hopping, and we got flirty, it ended up being a date. I generally have a RBF on, and now that I’m working on it, I seem to be more approachable. It also helps that I’m showing openness to begin with, and for many women this in itself is a huge challenge. Don’t be afraid to speak to someone, but if she seems cold or distant, take the hint (but don’t take it personally) and move along. Also to note, in each of those situations, I platonically spent time with the guy for an hour+ before they broached the romantic aspect. Maybe they were just being careful, but it did help me feel comfortable and excited about seeing them again since we got to know each other without any pressure first.",concur
"For me, love is a verb. Not just some words about feelings. For me it's about mutual respect, understanding, and shared experiences. It's is about finding joy in each other's company, supporting one another's passions, and building lasting friendships that enrich our lives. If it's important to you, it's important to me because I care. It’s about exploring new adventures and having meaningful conversations that foster growth and connection. It's also about dedication and devotion and standing by each other through the good and bad times. It's also about embracing our differences and acceptance. Love requires regular attention in the form of shared experiences and mutual communication with the understanding of each other's perceptions. This is what love is to me. What's your version?","It's a shame that the English language barely has more than one word for 'love' - there are so many different forms and expressions of it, and each of them really deserves its own category and description! Love is complex and depends on the relationship, here are a few kinds that I can distil. Infatuation or puppy love: it feels joyful and thrilling to be with that person, you want to be your best for them, you admire them, you're kind of dipping your toes into intimacy and vulnerability with them but still care about keeping up appearances. The dynamic is usually volatile and ends up falling apart, because neither of you know the other or yourselves all that well. Companionate love: best friends who know each other deeply, respect and want the best for each other, are on the same wavelength and being together mostly feels easy and frictionless. If conflict arises it's out of care, not ego. There's trust and it's easy to take the other person on good faith. ""In love"": Feels quite magical. Being around the other person makes you feel really good, you have sparkling chemistry, they bring out positive sides of you that were dormant. You admire them and want to be closer to them, the way you get each other feels really special, and they start to take up a lot of your thoughts. You really care what they think and feel about you and want to be your best for them. You might have an idealised version of this person in mind that's not really the real them. Deep love: You know this person thoroughly, flaws and all, and still feel like they're incredibly special to you in a unique way. It makes you happy just to know they exist - without pressure or expectations. Their unhappiness causes you great distress, their happiness makes you happy. You care for them, want to protect them, even pity them a little for having to live in this hard world. Being around them, or simply knowing them, softens you as a person. You feel compassion more deeply. You want to be your best not for some fantasy, not for your ego's sake, but because loving someone in itself is a big, beautiful responsibility.",concur

"Location: Tennessee

I live in what used to be my grandmother‘s house. When she passed away in 2022, it became my uncle Butch’s house. I live here along with my uncle Roger, and we both paid him five dollars for a five year lease a year after grandma died.

On June 9, Roger assaulted me, resulting in a busted lip, bruises, cuts, and a broken nose. I then called the police and he was later arrested. I called Butch to tell him about this and he said that if Roger has to move out as a result of this, I have to move out too. He, along with everyone else in my family, are mad at me for calling the cops on Roger, just because he’s “family,” and trying to claim that I started it and touched him first, which was not true. Roger pressed his body up against me and pushed me into a wall and I pushed him to get him off of me.

Weeks later, my cousin Jase who’s 13, came to the house unannounced… again, and crawled through the doggy door since the doors were locked, again. He said that my dad told him to come down here once a day every day to check on me since I’ve went no-contact with my dad (whole other story). I told him and his mom that if people were so worried about my well-being, they could call the police and do a wellness check if they wanted to. Also, I told his mom that Jase doing this could be considered breaking and entering/unlawful entry, and this made her so mad that she called Butch and told him. (Jase already has a vandalism charge on him for breaking a teacher’s laptop, fyi.)

Butch came by later and said that if he ever got word the police were at the house for something as stupid as a wellness check, “things will be changing around here pretty damn fast.” He also told me not to get mad at Jase for crawling through the doggy door for ANY reason.

Now Butch is withholding my lease from me. I had asked him for a new copy since I misplaced my old one. Several days later, I asked if he found his copy of the lease and he responded with, “What does it matter?” I already told him that I needed it to apply for SNAP benefits and utility bill assistance.

What kind of legal recourse do I have here if any? Please lmk. ","Take pictures of the abuse, go to the police",concur
"I tracked almost everything while being on this journey I spent more than 627h hours since february on improving my life thats around 4hours per day, and that’s just the active doing stuff. All the passive mental work, reflections, mindset changes wasn’t even tracked.

For the last few years my life was pretty messed up, after some hard past years I spiraled more and more into depression… I slept till afternoon, ate junk, smoked weed and gamed all day.  

That lifestyle just made me even more depressed, I saw my friends succeeding, getting jobs, girlfriends, moving to new locations… just being happy. That honestly made me even more sad, so I decided at the beginning of the year to turn my life around, because I thought I either I´ll continue with this shitty lifestyle and eventually die feeling like I haven´t done anything with my life or trying to get out of this shit and finally make my life worthwhile. 

I convinced a friend of mine to join the journey because he was like me, depressed, hopeless, smoking weed all day and just miserable. 

The first thing we did was starting to go outside more, running or doing some small workouts, sweating made me feel so much better, it was like I sweated all the toxins and bad energy out of my body. My buddy and I got a gym membership together and started going 5x to the gym every week. 

The negative was that we still smoked weed pretty heavily in the evenings and after the gym, so 2 months ago we decided to also quit that shit as the next step, and what can I say. The last 2 months have been one of the best months, I finally sleep waay better with the new energy my workouts feel even better, I´m more awake and honestly way more confident due to the achievements I made the last few months. 

Together we started looking for jobs and after 4 years of unemployment, I got a job at a garden center, which is pretty funny considering my old ""hobby"" was growing weed lol. My buddy got a job in logistics, and I even started to get in contact again with an old love I had when I was younger. 

If you're where I was, just start with one thing. Go for a walk with a buddy or alone. Just move your body. You got this.

"I (26F) have been taking care of my little sister (8F) ever since our mom passed away three years ago. Our dad left long before that, and there’s no other family around. I went from being a wild 23-year-old figuring out her life, to full-time guardian overnight.

Some days I still don’t feel like an adult. I burn dinners, I cry in the shower, and I google “how to make a kid eat vegetables” like it’s a crisis. But I love her more than anything. I gave up a lot of my freedom, but never once regretted choosing her.

Last night, we were watching cartoons before bed and she curled into my side and asked softly, “Is it okay if I call you Mom sometimes?” I didn’t know what to say. I felt this weird ache in my chest. Like, I was honored... but also heartbroken that she even needs to ask that. That she’s missing that space in her heart.

I told her she could call me whatever makes her feel safe. She smiled and said, “Okay, Mom,” like it was the most normal thing in the world.

	•	Before we moved in together, we talked about finances. We agreed to split rent 50/50, I would pay all the bills, and groceries would be split 50/50. But recently, she refused to contribute to the joint account, saying I eat too much (obviously, as men, we tend to eat more than women). She also refused to help me load groceries into the car.

	•	A few days ago, she refused to do the dishes. We had agreed that one person cooks and the other washes dishes. She told me she was going to the gym and would wash the dishes when she got back. But instead, she came home and started yelling at me, asking why I was playing video games instead of washing the dishes.

	•	Every Sunday we clean the house together, but last Sunday I went out for an hour to grab food for us. When I came back, she had gone shopping for her skincare stuff. She was gone for five hours, and I ended up cleaning the whole house by myself.

	•	Every time I try to talk to her about these problems, she says, “Why don’t you wear a skirt? You act like a f***ing girl.”

	•	Every time I want to hang out with my friends, I invite her, but she always refuses to go.

	•	When we go out to eat, I always have to pay for everything.

"I Spent a lot of time digging into the science behind habits and motivation. Thought I’d share what actually helps people stay consistent:

1. **Progress is the best motivation.** You think you need motivation to start. In reality, you need visible progress to keep going. When you can see that something is working, you want to keep showing up. Think about it. First week in the gym, you're making beginner gains. Reading daily? You feel smarter fast. That early progress pulls you in. But when it slows down, your drive fades. That's when most people quit. James Clear said it best: “The best form of motivation is progress”. This doesn’t have to be complicated. Move paper clips from one pile to another. Tick a to-do list. Use an app. If you’re not tracking it, you’re not feeling it.
2. **Streaks give you something to lose.** When you're building a habit, the hardest part is showing up on the days you don't feel like it. A streak helps with that. It turns a habit into something you're not just building, but protecting. You hit day seven and day eight matters more. Your brain starts seeing the chain, and not breaking it becomes the new goal. It’s simple, but powerful. This is why language apps, fitness trackers, and even snapchat use it. Once you’ve got momentum, consistency stops being a decision and starts being automatic.
3. **Motivation fades. Identity doesn’t.** Telling yourself “I want to work out” works for a little while. But saying “I’m the kind of person who trains” sticks. That shift from action to identity is what makes a habit last. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits: true behaviour change is identity change. When you start acting like the person you want to become, the habit becomes part of your self-image. And once it’s tied to who you are, skipping it feels off. You don’t need constant motivation if the habit reinforces how you see yourself.
4. **You’re not lazy. You just lack structure.** Most people think they have a motivation problem, but what they really have is a systems problem. You’re not broken. You’re just trying to rely on willpower in an environment built for distraction. Setting goals feels productive, but goals don’t get you through hard days. Systems do. A goal might tell you where you want to go, but a system tells you what to do today. James Clear puts it clearly in Atomic Habits: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Without structure, your brain defaults to whatever is easiest. That’s not laziness, that’s efficiency. Build systems that guide your day. Waking up earlier, sleeping on time, knowing what task comes next. Whether that’s a planner, a checklist, or an app that takes the thinking out of it, structure is what makes consistency possible.
5. **Your environment beats your willpower.** You don’t skip your habits because you’re weak. You skip them because your setup makes the wrong choice easier. If your phone is right next to you, you’re going to pick it up. If junk food is on the counter, you’re going to eat it. Research from Wendy Wood shows that most of our daily actions are driven by environment and habit, not conscious decision. Willpower is unreliable.

6. **Reward matters more than you think.** You won’t stick with a habit if it only feels like effort. Your brain needs a reason to come back. That reason is reward. Not in a year, but today. You need a positive feedback loop. Something that tells your brain, “this is working, do it again.” Studies in neuroscience show that dopamine doesn’t just respond to pleasure. It responds to anticipated reward. When the brain expects a payoff, it is more likely to repeat the behaviour. A 1997 paper by Schultz et al. found that dopamine spikes when we predict a reward, not just when we receive one. This is why gamification works. Progress bars, streaks, and small visible wins give your brain a reason to keep going. Make the habit feel rewarding now, and it becomes easier to repeat tomorrow.

I work for a large retail company that has its own credit card program. We are heavily encouraged to ask customers if they would like to apply for said credit card. 

A new update to our registers makes a pop-up appear during checkout that states the customer has been pre-approved for our company’s credit card. With the new updated, the store manager has insisted that we are legally required to tell the customer they have been pre-approved and ask if they want to sign up for the credit card. When I asked why it was illegal for me to refrain from asking if they wanted to sign up, I was told it was for “anti discrimination” reasons. “It will look like we pick and choose.”

"I’ll try to make this short . My grandmother is about 78. Always been very healthy and gets around great , plans everything . A few years ago probably sometime around Covid we noticed she might ask frequent questions over and over again. My grandpa said they took her to the hospital and doctor said it most likely was due to “Covid brain”🙄 brain fog from getting Covid . So that’s what my grandpa ran with when anyone asked about grandmas memory . She also was quick to catch herself when she asked the same questions over and over again and would say “ugh Covid brain” well the last year we’ve really started to decline rapidly . She got lost when she was driving , she asked me the same question 3 times within 5 minutes . Doesn’t remember big life events . My dad finally pressed my grandpa that she needed a specialist and went with them . The doctor did a few test and we figured that it would take a few weeks to get an answer but to my dads surprise he told him before the appointment ended that she definitely had Alzheimer’s . That she would need family support and that she shouldn’t be driving anymore . We’ve been trying to research stages and figure out how long we have until she completely forgets . Keep in mind she’s most likely had this about 3 years now before her actual diagnosis

• she doesn’t remember he nephew had a child

"I've noticed a trend this year of women unmatching if I don't respond to an app message within 24 hours which to me seems pretty fast. I could understand if it was 48-72 hours, but 1 day at the age of 35+ is perplexing. Everyone I know at our age is busy AF so I would expect some grace. Personally I work a highly demanding job that involves a lot of work travel and problem solving plus I have an active social life and do a fair amount of personal travel too. Sometimes I'm so busy that I don't even think to look at the apps for a day or if I do see the message I am just to mentally exhausted to formulate a response. However, I always attempt to respond within 24-48 hours whenever I feel like I can. I have no problem talking to people in real life, but I get really bad writer's block when texting strangers I've never met. This is often compounded by the fact that a lot of women have next to nothing to go off of other than pictures on their app profiles and will give short responses to messages that don't keep a flow to the conversation. I only bring this up because when I do respond to a message I put a lot of time and effort into thinking of a response that will hopefully keep the conversation flowing. While I used to think I was dodging bullets with quick unmatchers this is becoming more and more common which is frustrating because I am interested, but I feel like I am not being given a shot.

I don't expect other people to be accessible all of the time especially in the beginning of a new convo so I just can't wrap my head around this idea. Also, I almost never unmatch people, but to each their own. Burn out is real these days and as someone who went through it really bad more than once in the last 5 years I totally understand if folks need some time to collect their thoughts or need a grace period because they got caught up in life. 

Can anyone give me some insight here?

Edit: 

1) ""However, I always attempt to respond within 24-48 hours whenever I feel like I can."" I suppose this line is unclear. It's better to say that I usually respond within 24 hours, but it may take up to 48 hours to respond. I send a response when I feel like I can provide a decent response and not something low effort for the sake of responding. I tend to respond 32-48 hours at max. 

A. Clearly, I need to clarify further. I typically look at the apps once in the morning and once in the evening. If I'm busy, it may only be once in the morning. Occasionally, life happens, and I can't get to it for a couple of days. This is the exception to the norm. Most people I chat with take 14-24 hours to respond anyways so this has not been a real issue. I've just noted that people are quicker to unmatch these days and was looking for some insight.

2) I love the suggestion of sending a quick ""Hey, I'm busy today, but I'll shoot you a message later"" rather than leaving someone hanging. 
",I think burnout goes both ways. Some people need to feel like communication has momentum to continue exploring a connection. Exchanging one message every other day makes that tough. I also wouldn't assume that they unmatched because of your response time unless that was actual feedback you were given. Unmatching occurs for a whole variety of reasons.,concur

"Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I've been wrestling with the cost of using different GenAI APIs. It feels wasteful to use a powerful model like GPT-4o for a simple task that a much cheaper model like Haiku could handle perfectly.

This led me down a rabbit hole of academic research on a concept often called 'prompt routing' or 'model routing'. The core idea is to have a smart system that analyzes a prompt *before* sending it to an LLM, and then routes it to the most cost-effective model that can still deliver a high-quality response.

It seems like a really promising way to balance cost, latency, and quality. There's a surprising amount of recent research on this (I'll link some papers below for anyone interested).

I'd be grateful for some honest feedback from fellow developers. My main questions are:

* **Is this a real problem for you?** Do you find yourself manually switching between models to save costs?
* **Does this 'router' approach seem practical?** What potential pitfalls do you see?
* If a tool like this existed, what would be most important? Low latency for the routing itself? Support for many providers? Custom rule-setting?

Genuinely curious to hear if this resonates with anyone or if I'm just over-engineering a niche problem. Thanks for your input!

"For context, we've been together for 3 years and when I met him he was kinda fat but his face was nice and he had a buzzcut with (from what I could tell) decent hair. He was around 90kg then. We worked on art projects together and talked about music and movies and I was fascinated by how much someone can know about things only I knew about until then. It was very sweet to see someone into similar things to my own so we hung out and eventually started dating. It was ok at first but we started running into issues very fast. He would keep closing off more and more and we would never leave the house for 2 years, our only 2 trips were a nightmare where he kept nagging how he doesnt wanna go anywhere, how trips are a waste of time etc. He lied to me about some things, wasnt very nice and gained like 30kg over his 90. This all resulted in me losing all attraction and feeling disgusted. I started training daily about 2 years ago while he eas getting fatter and the slow decline made me even more disgusted. I would go to combat sports/gym daily and would see all these happy, fit people and I would feel like shit when I came home to him.

My mom has been so convinced lately that she's getting better, and it breaks my heart. I've known she won't get better and that this disease will kill her, but it just really hit home today. She will not get better. She will die because of this. I don't really remember my mom prior to this, but she will never be that person again. The ""immature with no filter"" version of herself that she is now will disappear, too. She will become more and more of a different person. A shell. Unless therapy and stuff jogs my memory and recovers some suppressed memories, I will never know who she was.

My dad took my mom for a second opinion regarding Alzheimer's, which was when she found out. Neither parent has mentioned that doctor being mean. I'm even pretty sure my dad actually mentioned him being compassionate in his delivery of the diagnosis, and when I told my dad what my mom has said, he gave me one of those ""Yeah that's not what happened"" looks. My mom started saying that that neurologist is mean. I figured it was either a confused memory oops or that her mind started to equate bad news = bad doctor. This is in my words as hers were much less coherent, but she essentially said ""I wish I could tell him he's wrong because I'm doing so much better, and he can stuff it!"" I got ""nah-nah-a-boo-boo, you can't get me"" vibes from it, like from when you're a kid.

I know that part of Alzheimer's is the patients not realizing something is wrong, but people who rarely see her telling her she's better or a sketchy doctor telling her she'll get better are not helping. Mom has been a pretty compliant person so far, but I think we're starting to see that change. She's been more risky and ambitious lately (as a less extreme example: she tried to bring up a box of pop tarts and a bag of chips at the same time from the basement pantry despite her not doing well with stairs in general, and that's too much for her to carry; she's previously asked for someone to bring them up in the past), and I worry she's gonna get hurt or something because of it. There have been more and more incidents lately (a big bathroom mess not contained to the bathroom; me waking up while in a different floor of the house to the sound of her hyperventilating because her pantries got bunched up after she used the bathroom, and she didn't know how to fix it; and more), and I'm truly not sure if they just all tend to happen when I'm home alone with her (which is a significant amount of time), or if things happen when she's with my dad, and he just doesn't tell me.

I know all the things that have happened as of late are just a taste of what's to come, too. I feel bad that I'm trying to move out, but being here is..suffocating. Me trying to save them from drowning is just resulting in me drowning, too. I can't be the only one looking for a life vest and trying to keep us all afloat. I want to help some, but I can't prepare for my future with the way things are now. Not even just Mom needing care, but the way my dad handles things and all of the (unintentional) neglect and abuse I've experienced and witnessed happening to my siblings that I'm trying to work through in therapy. I did stress word dump some things at him after he got home from work (another incident happened while he was gone), so maybe that'll help. It hasn't before, but maybe. 

This is all a big rant, and I've stayed up way too late typing and retyping this out. Night time is the only time I have to myself where no one needs anything, and I have time to breathe and think. The rest is the time, I have to be ""on."" Smile. Cheerful. Patient. Laugh at the right moments. Keep Mom safe. All my feelings and thoughts go on lockdown until I'm alone. Then it all comes crashing down. It's like I'm holding my breath the entire day. The longer I have to hold it, the more severe the consequences are, and the more I'm gasping for breath when I do get a chance to breathe. 

I do not advocate for regular use of energy drinks, but at this point, I think I need some to get me through the days where I can't take a good nap. Though, getting on a better sleep schedule will help, too. I'll get back to working towards that tomorrow night.","I wish I could offer you suggestions, but my issues are almost exactly as yours.",concur

"This happened two weeks ago but me and my boyfriend have been bickering about it since and he's been cold with me so I decided to post about it. Throwaway because he has my Reddit account, but he doesn't view this sub. Also sorry for any issues, English isn't my first language

My (22F) parents raised me teaching me domestic skills at a young age, mainly cooking and baking. This wasn't because I was a girl, but it was because my mum thought it was a life skill and she came from a family where both men and women did a lot of cooking. My boyfriend (23M) was raised in a ""fast food house"" and never learned how to cook proper meals because he grew up on takeaway and microwave meals.

We've been together for a year and I count on my hand the amount of times he's actually attempted and made a half-way decent meal. I'm not some 5-star chef, but this grown man doesn't know how to make instant mashed potatoes, cook chicken, make pasta or bake a box of cake mix. He's even terrible when it comes to making foods where the cooking/baking/prep instructions are literally on the back or sides of the packaging.

I've asked him several times to try and learn. Watch a TV show, take a class, read a book about it, hell, even a YouTube or Tiktok video but he refuses to learn how to properly cook anything that's not a basic sandwich (he can't even toast his bread correctly even though I've shown him how to do it in a pan, in the oven and in a toaster)

The other day he tried to make a package of those flavored rice dishes and chicken and he overboiled the water all over our stove (we have a gas stove as well so we had to open all the windows since the flame went out) and managed to char the outside of the chicken and still leaving the inside raw (I still don't know how this was managed). I ended up stepping in and cooking our dinner for us after cleaning the rice water off the stove and scraping char bits off my pan.

He didn't help me cook this second time and when he came to eat I just got a little irritated and said that he needs to learn how to cook at least a few basic meals because I'm tired of always having to cook for him and sometimes clean up after his kitchen disasters.

He said he doesn't understand the big deal about it because I want kids, so that means that I'll be cooking and cleaning up messes constantly anyways. I argued back that it's completely different having to constantly cook for and clean up after a baby or child because they literally can't do it for themselves compared to a grown man who just refuses to learn. I also said that when I have kids I'm teaching all of them life skills like cooking so they won't be helpless and relying on their partner to take care of them like a child when they grow up.

He said I was overreacting and that I won't make a good wife or mother if I complain this much about cooking for people and cleaning up messes. He also called me a hypocrite because admittedly I'm not the most tidy person (he pointed out that my desk and bookshelf is a cluttered mess right now).

I do feel bad for arguing with him over this but I'm tired of having to constantly take care of him like he's a child. He's a grown man who should be able to do this for himself. I also hate how he's making me dislike cooking, because I actually love cooking and cooking for others, but he's just draining the fun out of it and I'm actually considering breaking up with him unless he actually starts showing an effort to learn how to cook, or to at least stop making such a mess with every failed attempt. I need some advice.

"When I was 28 and a single mom, 50% of my income went to my condo mortgage. I was also 30k in credit debt and 60k in student loan debt. I was making 65k a year. I was house poor and lived on credit cards. Then one night, I got into a car accident and realized my credit was so bad, I couldn't get a car loan. That's when I knew I needed a change and I faced the fact that I had little to no savings. I ended up buying a crappy car in cash and got intense on getting out of debt and increasing my income.

Today I am 33 with no consumer debt, paid cash for an upgraded car and I will have 100k saved in hysa by the end of August. I'm now making $210k a year. However I am still carrying my student loan debt. I haven't not increased any of my expenses from when I was younger so my monthly expenses are around $2700 a month. 

Because I worked so hard by myself to get out of that stress and dark place, I am so scared to let go of the money. I want to put a massive down payment on a home one day and start aggressively investing but I have the student loans. Can I get any advice on what I should do next with my money goals? ","If you make $210k a year, yet all your monthly expenses add up to just $2,700, you are very well off and on your way to actually becoming wealthy, and setting yourself up great for retirement, maybe even early retirement (FIRE). As you are debt free, aside from your student loans, I would: 1. Make sure you max out your 401k contributions, and take full advantage of any 401k matching your employer offers. Can't beat free money. 2. Throw the max $7,000 allowed per year into a Roth IRA. Look toward retirement savings now. 3. Tackle your student loans now. You already have a healthy emergency savings with $100k in the HYSA account. Usually 3 to 6 month's worth of expenses is recommended, which at 6x in your case ($2,700 monthly expenses), would have been $16,200. So, time to pay off your student loans quickly. We would need more info to know the best strategy on the student loan repayment, such as your total loan amount, whether the loans are federal or private, and at what interest rate, but generally speaking, work on getting rid of your student loan debt as quickly as you can to become fully debt free. 4.

"TL;DR Partner (33F) became chronically ill and our sex life basically ended, how do I (31F) handle my feeling of resentment and grief over losing this aspect of our relationship

My partner and I have been together over ten years and have one kid together. We’ve been in individual therapy and couples therapy for the past several years due to big life things, and have worked to strengthen our already pretty solid foundation. However, for the last year my partner has been dealing with a chronic illness (main symptoms are pain, fatigue, and depression) that has affected our lives greatly. I’m dealing with some caregiver fatigue and have been feeling pretty disconnected recently, unfortunately this is further exacerbated by a lack of sex/physical intimacy. Since becoming parents our sex life has understandably changed, but now it is essentially nonexistent; I am struggling. Aside from just missing it, sex helps me reconnect with her when it feels like we’re drifting, especially in times of stress. I am starting to feel resentment and I really don’t want to feel this way towards her. I feel like I’m too young to lose this part of my life, and while I can’t imagine being intimate with anyone else at this point, I almost feel like I might need that. I know my partner isn’t choosing this and I don’t want to hurt her. 

How do people handle this aspect of a relationship with a chronically ill partner and how do I nip this feeling of resentment in the bud?


Sorry this is so rambling. ",You’re not alone! My wife is experiencing the same symptoms! Ever since she had our twins she has been going through it and our physical relationship has greatly suffered since she got pregnant. It’s hard trying to be the strong one to make sure that everything is taken care of and still make sure you’re being attentive to the babies and her as well. It gets VERY overwhelming at times. I just keep trying to talk to her and I’m trying to develop a different level of intimacy while hoping the physical part comes back eventually. I understand where you’re coming from where you don’t want to step out but really feel like it may be a last resort. The thought has crossed my mind more than once. But I couldn’t ever do that. It’s hard to watch someone you love so much going through such a hard time when this is supposed to be such an exciting time. I know this isn’t much advice but sometimes knowing you’re not alone can be reassuring. Hang in there. Hopefully it gets better❤️,concur
Is there a simple way to qualify for hospice with long covid? Besides also having cancer with long covid. Or maybe a disease that one could intentionally contract that will shorten lifetime down to year to qualify?,"Go in open minded and instead of just saying “Long Covid” refer to the individual health issues you may have been diagnosed with. Pulmonary, chronic fatigue, pain, muscle weakness, mental confusion. Etc. You have to explain what services you are looking for. I think you may have preconceptions about what hospice is about that may not longer be true.. Big cities have many different hospice organizations…some with a broad range of services, some limited. One of the best ways to access services like hospice is a referral from your PCP. Again rather than just saying I want hospice say, I need support at home — home nurses, an emergency number to call, household help. Transportation to doctor’s visits, food or housing support. In my experience, when I go to the doctor there are a lot of questionnaires to fill out. Three of the “how often” questions will get you access to more services: How often in last period of time: are you depressed or thinking of harming yourself. Do you have had food insecurity. Do you have housing insecurity. If you’re looking for more access to benzos etc, you might have better result by going to a pain management clinic. Restrictions and record keeping requirements are so high on these, most doctors don’t have the time or staff to keep up with reporting requirements.",concur

The tittle pretty much sums it up. Me (19M) and my gf (18F) have been together for a year and 4 months, and the start we didn’t go through each other’s phones at all but now we’re very comfortable with eachother, we tell each other everything and are very intimidate and happy together. 
She always posts me on social media, brags about me to her friends (from what I know), and all around she has no red flags besides this (that I know of).

The problem is that I always let her go through my phone. She never “searches” for anything in particular, just randomly when we’re on a date she can take it and look through my gallery, or she checks my notifications, sometimes even ig chats.

Although, whenever I even try and touch her phone, I don’t last 4 seconds with it because she imediatelly grabs it. Not in an agressive way but in a worried annoyed sort of way.

Whenever I do look through her phone is when she is holding it and we’re both looking together but that’s it. 

I asked her about this multiple times, she always says “I just don’t like people going through my phone that’s all. It’s not a big deal”.
Or “I’m a woman so I should have my privacy, you’re a man.”

Call me crazy but I don’t think that’s fair.

And the kicker is, she knows my phone password and can go on it anytime because I have nothing to hide, and she’s done this multiple times, but I don’t even know her phone password.

I feel like I should have the right to check her phone if she always checks mine, no?
TL;DR: Gf doesn’t let me touch her phone even tho she always checks mine, and she always makes up the same excuse for it too.","That's completely not fair.

Well, her primary doctor called yesterday and said her MRI looked good.

My mom is 78 and is starting to get very forgetful. She will repeat stories 3 times in a 30 minute car ride. I can’t always tell if it’s just to talk or if she forgot she already told me. 
She forgot to pay her rent last month and was just very confused when i sat down with her to figure out what happened. She asked me multiple times to double check that the check didn’t clear and come out of her account - no check was ever sent.  There was nothing to clear. I’d explain that and 3 minutes later she’d ask again for me to make sure “that check didn’t clear”
Doctors appointments, or anything other than normal daily activities just confuse her and overwhelm her.  She has me call her doctors a lot to get info for appointments or to ask what she may need. I end up over at her house multiple times a week to help her figure something about.
I just want to make it clear I don’t mind. I don’t want to sound like it bothers me. I LOVE my mom so much and don’t mind running over to help her figure things out (she isn’t ready to just give me control of her bills yet), but i have 3 kids and I’m always on the run. I can’t get her to understand if we could sit down together once a week even and do these things it would be so much easier. She will just randomly decide at a day and time to pay her bills and then when she gets confused she calls. If i don’t go over she is VERY frazzled and it will get worse. So i usually stop and go over.

"So as I understand it, treatments for depression often centre around the thoughts that come along with depression (I'm unlikable, I'm worthless, I'm no good at anything) being untrue, and therefore your depression will improve if you can recognize this and think more accurately. That's all well and fine if that's the case, but what if my depressive thoughts are true? 

Like I truly genuinely believe I'm not that likable. It's been the case my whole life. I've always been the person no one really wants to be friends with or close with; people are happy to be cordial and friendly but I'm just not that likable. People dont want to be around me a lot or be close to me. It's happened in literally every environment I've ever been in: school, university, extracurricular groups, different workplaces, with extended family, in mom's groups etc. It's so hard to see others only interested in getting to know and befriend other people. 

I also genuinely believe I'm not worth much. I have basically no talents at all. Everyone else seems to have so much they're good at, so much to offer and give, why was I not gifted with anything? I feel I have nothing to offer. It's so hard seeing other people who are so smart, talented, good looking, successful... And I'm none of that. 

I feel like I've looked at this objectively as I can. I'm not being over dramatic but really feel like it is the case that I'm unlikable and not worth much. So if the thoughts are true and inherently lead to depression... Is there any hope for me? Or does it just make sense to be depressed because my life is and likely always will be depressing? ","So here's the thing... Thought by it's very nature is not true, and can never be true. Before you burn me at the stake hear me out... Take a good look at your hand, the back and the palm. Now close your eyes and picture your hand. Is that your hand in your mind? Picture your phone in your mind. What are the calls? How long was each call and at what time? Is that your phone in your mind? You can picture a glass of water but you can't drink it, can you? Thought by it's very nature is representative of something but it is not the thing itself. And it's coloured by our moods and conditioning. What power does a thought have? What power does a thought you don't believe have? A thought about my house burning down is no more scary than a cloud that looks like a lion. I know it sounds a bit radical but really look at it. Who or what would you be if, just for a moment, you didn't engage that thought or believe it? THAT is the truth of who you are. It's interesting that our nervous systems are designed for wellbeing.

I have been here for 11 days now, and while things are looking very good for my prognosis and whatnot… I am so scared that I will be here for the rest of my life.

They have stated I will be able to go home after my initial Lumbar Puncture, tomorrow afternoon. However, my house is obviously not setup/ready for a cancer patient to live in. My fiancé and I just added a second puppy to our household, and she likes to bite. The first thing the docs told me today, was that I cannot allow that to happen, which I understand.

They have also stated there can be no mold in the house, but we live in an older house, and I’m almost positive there is some hiding in the walls.

I was the one making the money with my job, and I have been told I cannot go back to work for another 6 months. I have no idea what to do. There are a few other family members who live in the house, but they do not seem to be grasping the magnitude of my situation, and I am not seeing responses for helping out wherever they can. I have always done what I could to help out with the house, as well as helping them with anything they may need, and it’s an awful feeling to not receive any of that back at a time like this.

My finances are completely shot now, and I have no idea what to do. I have insurance and short-term disability from my work, but I have no idea when that will actually kick in and help.

I could use some advice and any tips from past experiences. I’m a very over dramatic person as it is, and just thinking about how I may never be able to just be home is really defeating.

My father had cancer a decade ago. He went into remission, and was doing great, but then he caught a fever, went into a coma, and was gone within a week. I can’t stop thinking about that and how fast all of this could happen.

Anyone with dogs… are you able to be with them still? Am I ever going to be able to cuddle with them again? Am I allowed to take them outside to the bathroom, even if I do not handle the cleanup?

What types of changes did you make to accommodate? Humidifiers/air filters? I just don’t know what to do and I’m scared. Please, if anyone could throw some light my way, I would truly appreciate it.

","OP, it is such a tough spot to be in, and unfortunately, when you have always been the provider or the one holding things together, people around you often fail to recognize when you need help. They are just used to you handling everything. But here is the hard truth: unless you tell them directly and specifically what you need, they probably will not step up. Not because they are uncaring, but because they are used to leaning on you, not the other way around. You may need to sit everyone down and clearly say, “I cannot do it right now. I need you to step in and help with A, B, and C.” It should not take that kind of pointed conversation, especially when to us it's obvious that help is required... but it often does. You are not alone in this, and I am really sorry you are having to carry the emotional weight of this on top of everything else. Keep advocating for yourself. You absolutely deserve support right now. ❤️‍🩹🙏",concur

One of my workers made well over 1k and i only made this much after deductions and taxes. I get a 30 minute unpaid lunch break. Does this look accurate?

I start nursing school soon so I’m being very frugal with money. ","Hey! I’m not a payroll expert or anything but I might be able to shed some light on a couple of things. In Ontario, your stat holiday award is determined by a 28/20 proration calculated starting the last day of the pay period before the holiday. So in this case you’d start counting backwards 28 calendar days starting on June 29th. That’s where that .82 hours is coming from. If you have access to your timesheets you might be able to double check the math on that number! Your vacation pay looks like the line labelled “vacation savings pay” and should be 4% of the gross pay (in this case your regular pay plus the holiday pay). Your income tax seems REALLY high, like $100 more than what I got when I put your numbers through the PDOC on the CRA website. Maybe reach out to the people who do your payroll to check your TD1? Unless you are voluntarily over-contributing to federal/provincial tax that number should be a bit lower. If this is your summer job and last year you were 17 you were also exempt from CPP because you were under 18 which would also make a difference if you were to compare your pay this year to last year. Hope this helps, but also your best course of action is to ask the people who do the payroll to explain your stub to you!",oppose

"How do you figure out who you really are when ADHD makes you feel like a chameleon?

I’m 23, and I’ve struggled for a long time with feeling like I don’t have a real personality. I also have bipolar disorder, but I think my ADHD plays a big role in this too.

I have interests and things I like, but deep down, it feels like I’m constantly mimicking other people. Whether it’s how I dress, talk, or present myself, I’m usually just pulling from people I admire or think are cool. My style is all over the place, and I think a lot of that comes from wanting to be liked. I care way too much about how people see me, and that’s made me kind of a pushover.

I often feel like I’m a chameleon, changing depending on who I’m around, instead of being grounded in who I am. I’m confident in how I look physically, but I don’t feel confident about who I am on the inside.

I really want to build a stronger sense of self, and feel comfortable being me — even if that changes sometimes. I want to stop overthinking everything I do and just feel more genuine.

If you’ve felt this way before, how have you worked through it?

"throwaway account because lowkey paranoid lmao

I'm at an employee at this advertisement and marketing company. TLDR; we make infographics and commercials for clients.

We make original stuff. At the very least used to. Company had big shot clients.

And then the boss started turning to AI to ""streamline"" efforts.

It started out small; AI on the backgrounds. AI to make character designs. I don't agree with it. I hate it. But whatever; I'm just here to work.

And then; he wanted to train us to start learning how to prompt.

And then it just entirely became ""let's have the AI make the entire video for us.""

Haven't had good clients in a while. Pretty sure its because this company is getting blacklisted left and right from the ""content"" it churns out. Imagine being an artist forced to prompt? Wrestling with the LLM when I could easily just draw this.

But no. ""It's too slow to draw. We can prompt this in 20 minutes.""

It's just bad. Like. Genuine bad bad.  I'm not even going to talk about the ethical stuff. Aesthetically wise, its just bad.

It's inconsistent. There is that shit yellow tint everywhere; and the logistical nightmare that'll happen when client inevitably will ask for revisions.

I’m 24 female diagnosed with stage three uterine cancer. My first doctor told me I could save me eggs but I needed a full hysterectomy. I had an mri and he wouldn’t share my mri results until I had a second opinion. I went to Moffit for a second opinion and decided to stick with that doctor. The very first appointment I told her how important having children was to me and asked for recommendations to a fertility clinic. She said there was no need because she wasn’t going to remove my ovaries. She reiterated this at 2 other appointments I had with her. After a second dnc and mri she informed me that everything needs to go and I will probably need chemo so there’s no use in leaving my ovaries there anyways. I’m so heartbroken. The only thing I’ve wanted was children. And I tried to ask for resources to save my eggs. I can’t help but feel upset. I will never have children of my own. And she denied me of that when she told me not to save my eggs,"I know you are upset right now and want to blame someone, maybe just blame cancer. It is total shit to have. It seems to me moffit (great center) thought it was totally possible to save your ovaries till the next mri when things changed. I highly doubt they lied for no reason. The reality is you would be in the middle of the process to save eggs and had it interrupted by the next mri results and be forced to abandon that. Most important to doctors is your life.

"Long story short I gave my first bj a couple weeks ago and I can’t get it out of my mind. Not only was it nice just cause it was sexual, but it made me realize a lot of things about myself simple bc it was so intimate and it was impossible to not be affected by the nearness. This wasn’t even with someone I really know, just some cute guy for a hookup (with just my mouth).

During it, he put his hand on my back and it was the NICEST feeling.

I’ve gotten hugs from family, had acquaintances rub my back before but none of that has ever felt that good. I can still feel it, and that and the genuinely amazing feeling of intimacy makes me want to cry.

What makes me want to cry isn’t just that it felt so good and I realized what I’ve been missing out on, but the fact that letting someone that close makes them see the worst of me and it’s just not lovable and makes people not feel good so they associate me with bad feelings that they don’t want to be around.

I was so awkward, and the moment made me realize how much I dissociate around others, minimize myself, make myself say stupid things, accidentally say them too. It’s just a mess; a social freak at 28.

"For context - around new year me and my bf had gone on very few dates and I made comment about wanting to gain more muscle. I’m a regular gym go-er - 5-6x per week etc. A few months into dating he picked me up after a run, I was wearing a sports bra and leggings and he looked at me and said I needed to work on my abs. I pointed it out as being insensitive and made it known I didn’t like it but teased him about it jokingly also. He would then just make a comment here and there about how I should do more cardio, how “we” should work out more so we could look better in pictures etc. (he doesn’t go to the gym btw).

He said that as my boyfriend he should be able to tell me and have a say in my body and that he was just trying to motivate me and he would want me to tell him if he was gaining weight. He ended up saying sorry and that he never meant to hurt me. But it did hurt. And a few days ago I told him I couldn’t forget about it and it was making me think twice whenever I needed to eat - I said I knew it wasn’t his intention but that it was affecting me in this way.

"I, '26F' want to break up with my boyfriend, '27M'  after almost 2 years..

I don't know how to break up with my partner as I still care for him but I know I deserve better. 

A little backstory, we met on Tinder in November 2023 and moved into together very quickly (2-3 months), everything was fine until maybe 6 months in where we stopped being intimate and after weeks of pushing he told me he didn't find me attractive anymore. This was the night before my aunties funeral which sucked even more.

We worked through that then a few months later he tells me he is going on a one month work trip, missing our 1 year anniversary. I was upset but got over it. Then a few weeks before he leaves he says he wants to take his family dogs in as his mother is wanting to give them away. We decide then to move house however we struggle to find something before he leaves so I am stuck moving everything into a storage unit and moving back in with my parents while his mother holds onto the dogs a bit longer. 

Maybe a week and a half into his trip, my grandfather has a heart attack and ends up in the ICU for two weeks. I call him to tell him he may have to leave his trip early as he is most likely going to die. Me and my grandfather were super close so I was really struggling and he knew this. He tells me he can't leave early, not really giving me an answer about why. Just an insight I know he wasn't cheating as I know it seems sus but we would video chat while he was away and knew some of his work mates so I knew where he was and what he was doing most of the time. 

My grandfather eventually passes away and I am devastated. I am constantly crying and won't eat, but what sucked the most was I had no support. I had to take over planning some of the funeral to help my grandmother and aunt. The funeral was terrible as I had no one to help me through it. 

After all of that, I end up finding us a house to live in which was great so I then move most of our stuff into this house alone. The last week of the trip he calls me and tells me after this work trip he is quitting as he is not performing well  and if he doesn't they are most likely going to fire him anyway. (he works in a sales role and is only casual)

I was so angry that I did all of this, struggled so much while he was gone just for him to quit. But I said nothing and supported him anyway. I went back to full time work as I was only part time before this and supported us. 

January 2025, 1 week before my birthday I found out he cheated on me during that period where he did not find me attractive. From what I could see it was just texting a girl who lives in another state where nudes were sent but there was plans to meet up when she came to Sydney so I don't know if they actually did or didn't. I confronted him about it and he admitted to it straight away. He said he understood if I left him but I felt cornered as we had just signed this new lease and he had no where to go so I decided to stay. 

It's now July 2025 and he still has no job, no money and I pay for everything (rent, bills etc) I can't keep doing this. We had a discussion about 3 months ago where he said he wanted to move out as he feels like he has had no time to be alone in a few years. I took it rough but eventually agreed and decided since he has the dogs I will move back to my parents when he is a bit more stable. He has made no serious moves to fix anything so I've decided to just throw him into the deep end and am moving back home over the next few weeks. 

I want to break up with him once I have moved out but am struggling as I still care for him and it has been so long since everything happened I feel I have no right to be upset anymore. I should have moved on and I feel terrible but I just can't be in this relationship anymore. I feel like I put 100% into this relationship and it's killing me but I don't know how to do it.

"Ok listen, this is not a religious rant at all. This is a rant about people, especially men, because they’re usually the one proposing marriage, fundamentally misunderstanding the point of a marriage. Marriage is not about love, it’s not about sex, or family, or kids. Marriage is about legal protection for both parties.

However, his parents live clear across the country in another time zone and they aren’t on good terms. If something happens tomorrow, there will be no one to make any tough calls. My friend was shocked to learn this and??? Why are you surprised? Do people think gay couples fought so hard for marriage because equality and rainbows! No! They fought so their partners wouldn’t have to die alone in a cold hospital room, so that there would be someone to make those tough end of life decisions, so that someone who loves them and knows their wishes can make hard choices on their behalf. Marriage is a binding legal contract that ensures your partner receives your assets upon your death so they can rebuild their life from scratch, it ensures there’s going to be someone who respects your wishes making hard medical calls on your behalf, damn, in some cases a marriage is the difference between life and death! I’m just so frustrated watching them and watching couples like them who don’t get it. It doesn’t matter how much you love your partner or how long you’ve been dating, or if you have kids together.

"I was with my now ex for 3 years, and the whole time he was texting a friend of his, having pet names for each other, and going to each other's houses alone often. He says he didn't physically cheat on me, but even though the messages weren't sexual, they were a bit too ""close"" for my liking. Sometimes I felt like she was his best friend instead of me. He always gaslighted me into thinking I was jealous, but this type of emotional intimacy is not normal when in a relationship. He told me he would never stop talking to her and I broke up with him.

"I had a teratoma tumor (Stage 1B) with a neoplasia in situ (stage 0) and had surgery 5 weeks ago and feel great honestly, pre-surgery I thought I was dying and after surgery I have improved in every way so when I got the final diagnosis it felt like, okay this is finally done with and can move on, but then they did blood tests and the numbers are way off and now, suddenly they are raising serious concerns and now ports, PET scan and 3 month of aggressive chemo by the tumor board is pushing for immediate action even though, I'd like to see more blood tests given the time frame.

The tumor also produced large amounts of estrogen which caused significant body changes contributing to pain as well.

* **Left testis, radical orchiectomy:**
* **Organ-confined post-pubertal type teratoma:** The tumor is a teratoma (a type of germ cell tumor) that is confined within the testis and has not spread beyond it. ""Post-pubertal type"" refers to a form of teratoma that occurs after puberty, which behaves differently from pre-pubertal teratomas.
* **Spermatic cord margin negative for tumor:**
* **Pathologic stage pT1b pNX (AJCC 8th edition):**
   * **pT1b:** The tumor is limited to the testis but has certain features such as size or involvement that place it in this specific category.
   * **pNX:** Lymph nodes were not assessed or cannot be assessed (meaning they don't have conclusive data on lymph node involvement from this specimen).
* **No yolk sac tumor identified despite elevated AFP:** Although your blood tests showed elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker often elevated in yolk sac tumors, none was found in the tissue examined. They checked carefully using special stains (immunohistochemistry) and didn't find clear evidence of yolk sac tumor cells.
* **Small focus of germ cell neoplasia in situ:** This means there are some abnormal germ cells present in the testis that could be the source of elevated beta-hCG levels (another tumor marker).
* **Overall: Post-pubertal type teratoma with no clear evidence of other germ cell tumor components.**

It was removed with no evidence of more aggressive tumors, with clear margins and no invasive spread detected.   CT Scan with contrast only detected the 3cm teratoma, everything else looked clear.  X-Ray of the same area revealed bone structure also clear,   CT Scan without contrast of chest also showed clear results.

Pure mature teratoma (no yolk sac, no embryonal carcinoma, no choriocarcinoma).

* Confined to testis with clear margins.
* No lymphovascular invasion reported.

Blood Test Results - Surgery to remove the tumor occurred on June 16th

Estrogen, Blood, Serum  
June 5th 390  
July 8th 340

LD  
June 5th 1087  
July 8th 1300

This is a concern, but I had surgery and a hematoma formed, which could be a reason for this?

Beta-HCG, Quantitative  
June 5th 2050  
July 8th  1750

AFP

June 5th 321.4  
July 8th 560

This is the concerning part, also the surgery was on June 16th which could further increased the AFP in the time frame,  this is likely the cause of the concern and subsequent Chemo request?

No actual checks of the lymph nodes were done because the tumor was supposedly removed with clear margins,  The surgeon also detected a hematoma in the removed testis part which could also raise certain levels.

**Bottom line, here - is there a benign reasoning for this, should I request another blood marker panel first before just jumping straight into 3 months of destructive chemo,   I can still feel firmness on the surgery site given its still healing, and can feel the small lump of the hemotoma where the surgeon located it on my two-week post op appointment.**

**I know, microscopic spread was not confirmed, the surgeon started that tumor burn-out was his professional opinion,   I have an appointment with the oncologist on Wednesday and I feel like I should directly request a retest of the Beta HCG, LD and AFP at least,  if the AFP and LD are continuing to rise, that could mean - either microscopic spread or possible hidden tumor somewhere outside of the area's that were tested?**

Reasonable assumptions, could it also mean something sneaked by and infected some lymph nodes that are swollen,   that swelling also does not automatically mean cancer, they could be reactive to the pain, surgery too.

**On top of all this, my house is problematic for chemo therapy in general, we have cats, a dog and a cockatiel,  plus we have limited space, mildew issues and other potential issues.** ","If you did have to do chemo, all of my male friends that I know had testicular cancer did inpatient chemo, so I’m not sure why your house situation would matter. The mildew situation probably isn’t great, but there’s nothing wrong with doing chemo while having pets. I’m on chemo right now, and have not been warned off at all from interacting with my dog. With that being said, some of your numbers do seem concerning, but obviously an in-depth conversation should be had with your oncologist before you’re doing something as serious as starting chemo. They should be better able to explain other possibilities for why these numbers might be elevated besides cancer.",concur

"My friend had bought a Skoda Octavia a couple of years ago. Said it was his dream car. He took a ₹20 lakh loan for it. EMI was around ₹70K a month, way more than what made sense for his salary. He loved that car. Drove it to work, on late night drives, weekend trips, everything. It was his thing.

But over time, it started to sink in. His savings drained. Every month felt like survival. No buffer, no peace of mind. He managed to keep up with payments for about a year and a half. Office salary, bonus, side hustle, everything went into keeping that car.

Yesterday he sold his car and cried. He said this was the worst decision he had ever made and that his dream was short lived. Said if he had planned better, maybe he could have owned it properly one day. He used the money to clear the loan. Told me he had no savings but at least now he would have some cash to get through the month. And that he finally realised no one is coming, there’s no miracle that gives you money to fix things.

The car drained him so much that even his credit card debt piled up, that’ll take another 5 months to clear. 

Owning something you can’t afford isn’t ownership. It’s a leash. And if you’re already feeling that tightness, even a little, you probably know what needs to be done.

Take care of yourself. Even if it feels heavy right now, you’ll get through it.","Your friend was lucky that his car sale covered the entirety of his loan payoff completely, and he walked away not owing anything extra. Around here (US) much of the time an expensive car comes with a loan a lot higher than what a car can sell for, and that leaves the seller often with $8 to $10k money to pay out of pocket just to get rid of the car and the car loan altogether.",concur
"So, I'll try to safe you the whole 'woe is me' story, but some details are important. 

>Due to some trauma related mental health issues, as well as my upbringing leaving out a big chunk of the social spectrum (I believe my dad has pretty low EQ, and my mum has hella issues), dating has always felt like lifting above my weight. What didn't help was that around the time I started liking girls, my self-esteem was at an all time low, and being bullied a lot, I didn't really dare to tell someone I liked them. This I eventually overcame (in the most awkwardly adorable way), but it did set the tone for my dating experience trough-out my 20's. Long story short; there where some really nice, but mostly awful experiences, and a lot of 'what's wrong wit me'-flavored loneliness. A couple years ago I took a break from dating to do some mental health work, something I'm still working on, although I'm proud to boast considerable progress. 

  
I'm excited to return to dating as soon as I feel I'm ready enough to start dating from a constructive place. I feel like I can be a better (more sane) partner, and I feel like I'm (almost) sensible enough to start dating from a place of mutual respect, rather than defeatism and bitterness. I'd really like to break that cycle. and go on dates and feel like it's 2 people getting to know each other, rather than me begging for scraps. I want to make a move on someone and feel like I have half a clue of what I'm doing, maybe even enjoy the chase. Flirt a bit, maybe have a fun fling, maybe not. 

And who knows, maybe fall desperately in love. Although I'm ok if that doesn't happen. I'm no longer looking for someone to save me :) 

Thing is, excited as I am, I have hella cold feet about getting back on that horse. I have some pleasant experiences to guide me, but also 20odd years of fear and loathing looming over my shoulder. On top of that, the current discourse on dating seems so full of stigma these days, that I've struggled to find some genuine support. Even amongst my friends. I'm really not sure where and how to approach finding and going on dates without feeling insecure about the lack of experience I have, or the position in Iife I'm expected to be at. (eg I have no short term interest in planning a happily ever after, especially the one with rings and home-grown poop-monsters).

Anyway, any advice, support, sources or anecdotes would be highly appreciated. 

**Tl;DR:** How TF do you get back on the dating horse if all you've ever done is cling on to the side of the saddle? ","If you and I were on a date, I'd want to feel wanted by you, pursued.

"I (21M) just finished my senior year of university (majored in business admin) in my home country. I always regretted not trying to get into good/prestigious U.S. schools as an undergrad and figured I'd give it a try for grad school. I got into several deferred MBA programs at M7 (top) schools. This would be an amazing opportunity to break into the U.S. job market and transition to interesting private sector roles (I work in government/admin right now). Also, the chance to live in a major U.S. city, meet loads of new people, and attend a world-renowned institution is super exciting.

But I also have a fair bit of trepidation - I've been reading stories on this subreddit of people who say their MBA wasn't worth it, who can't get jobs, etc. Currently, I have a salary of $80k plus earnings of $15-20k from side hustles. I didn't pay a cent for undergrad and due to scholarships/savings, I'm well ahead of my peers financially. None of my family or friends currently live in the U.S.

Breakfast: Catalina Crunch Protein Cereal 36 grams, Oikos triple zero yogurt, Nurri protein shake, 3 slices of canadian bacon, and sometimes a banana.

Lunch: I eat 6 oz of boneless skinned chicken breast, half an ounce of reduced fat shredded cheese, 26 grams of lite ranch, and 30 grams of spinach. I also take 2 fish oil pills, magnesium, ashwagandha, vitamin D and a multi vitamin. 

Dinner: I have a carb balance tortilla with 3 oz of ground beef, another half ounce of shredded cheese and 30 grams of low fat sour cream. 

Shake: I have a protein shake after the gym made with one cup of 1% milk, PB fit (a low fat peanut butter powder), 6 star whey protein, creatine, and collagen peptides.

Snacks: I often have 2 fruit snacks and a rice krispie as carbs before the gym. I also usually eat a single blueberry bagel in the evenings to cure my late night hunger.

 ","It sounds like a potential solution to this would be if your partner was able to give you reassurance that he is, in fact, confident he will be just as attracted to you after transitioning. I could see him being unsure about his feelings initially, that's totally fair to expect. But it's been enough time now that he should be able to reassure you he loves you just the same and will love you no matter what. Without this reassurance, I can see why you feel weird. It's confusing, like maybe you're not being true to yourself by staying with someone who doesn't fully appreciate who you are (your transition being a part of that).

So basically what the title says, my dad is overall good father, well besides sometimes - recently more often than not being a complete dick to me. His teasing involves that thing when you lock in a person and with closed fist scratch the top of the head, blocks my way and when I try to get past he grabs my wrists - crushes them in one hand and tries to pull my nose with the other, shoves me into the wall.

Yesterday he shoved me into glass cabinet and when I tried to go pas him he blocked my way and pushed me back. I screamed for him to stop, but he just laughed. My mother stood by and just told him to stop. I swore at him to basically 'fuck off' when I couldn't take it any longer and both my dad and mother looked offended. I started crying from the stress and finally I could go away, but not before him mocking my sobbing. Later I heard his conversation with my mom where she asked him why won't he stop he basically said 'What, I'm just happy, am I to better hang myself?'

When I ask it doesn't work, when I swear I don't respect my parents, when I try to remove myself from the situation my attempts are blocked.

Is there a way for me to tell him otherwise to stop? It brings me a lot of distress and he doesn't do those things to my brothers, sometimes to my mom, but she has better authority when she tells him to stop. I can't ask anyone for help in my circle, for noone cares as everyone says it's just 'playfull teasing' or some holier than thou aunties bash it behind his back but laugh when he does thosw things to me.

"46M, inattentive ADHD, diagnosed at 45y old...

Late diagnosis, only found out after 3 burnouts at work (first after being promoted to manager).  
Very similar story to Brett's:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNCDwUv\_gkQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNCDwUv_gkQ)

I see many men here in their 40s hitting a similar ""wall"" and I wonder if ADHD + midlife crisis hits us even more hard compared to people without ADHD?

With ADHD, as long as I have a goal (career, hobby, relationships) - I can go after it (yepp, often hyperfixate on it) and it keeps me going for a while...

But now, it seems like I have fullfilled all the goals and... not sure how to describe it... ""lost the ability to dream""? I mean my dreams (like to live in a small house somewhere near a forest/lake, away from busy cities) are not very ""compatible"" with my family, so I don't go after them...

And goals like a new car, bigger house or more money don't motivate me anymore...

Now I value my ""holy peace"" time more than anything...  
Spending time in nature, walking/rucking a lot to allow my mind to ""wander"" and clear out...

Any other guys in the 40s feeling similar?

They say I'm mixed with both types but I severely lack in in-person communication with anyone who is a fast talker or loud situations. It's like I just can't access certain parts of my brain. I've been seeing a counselor and the more we talk and try new things, the more I see that I actually don't have social anxiety. I might just need a stimulant. SSRIs have failed me. Also tried busprone and even gabapentin. Without luck. I tend to feel better when I'm excited about something. This led my wife to mention small things she's noticed. My inner voice shuts off with caffeine and I can rest. I'm talkative when I do certain things like binge eating or have sweets. Of course alcohol does the same initially but I'm a zombie like mess for the next few days where I don't want to talk to anyone. My wife thinks stimulants may be the key but so far no one will prescribe them. Maybe I need a psychiatrist instead of a counselor. The ones who diagnosed me completely ghosted me as soon as I got my diagnosis and said to just keep going with the counselor. (Might be an insurance issue) Anyways, We live rural now because we have our own home based business and it's so much cheaper, but I honestly miss growing up in Chicago. I feel a calmness in chaos but Everytime we go back to visit, it's just not the same and I get pissed off with traffic and people in general. I think rural living is the best place for me to figure things out and continue to grow. I wouldn't say I'm going through a midlife crises but I'm desperately reliving memories with a new set of eyes, frantically trying to figure out so many life altering events from my past and how I was actually my own worst enemy. It's definitely making me want to do things to compensate that would seem like a midlife crises now",concur

"I was diagnosed last year in September and was told to wait 1 year before my next appointment that is coming up soon (hopefully) and have felt that I need medication for years. I also asked for therapy for years but only told I'm in a queue while my issues destroy my life.

I struggle with impulsivity, overwhelming feelings, anxiety and social fears, low energy and all sorts of things. I had a bad childhood and trust issues, it has been suggested but never diagnosed PTSD because of my past and that I have nightmares, defensive behaviours and emotional triggers.

Since I got my first apartment at 17 I accrued debt, struggled to survive while feeling overwhelmed and my emotions causing problems. I made many mistakes economical and wasn't strong enough to endure having a job, no guidance and no support, eventually I got my first lasting job at 27, having been isolated due to agoraphobia and failing at job activities, relationships and such.

I always been self-aware and worked with the belief that I can be better, but my fears, anxiety and depression coupled with emotional instability, made it impossible despite occasionally months of hard discipline, I end up crashing and losing self-control.

I have a lot of debts from impulsive ordering take out, shopping and collecting part-payment plans. Recently I managed to finally get a loan with low rate, gathered up majority of my expansive loans but feel I'm going downhill again, because I have below minium to afford living, most months I barely can afford food and others I can't pay my monthly costs, my income is part-time and studying.

It's hard trying to focus on studying when I get drained easily by working in retail, but even if I'm alone at home I get drained of energy and willpower.

I am kind of betting my hopes on medication but I'm angry and disappointed of the wasted years. Fearful of the unknowns.

I want permanent change for the better.","Yes, I always try to tell myself that what I am feelings is likely just an overreaction and usually try to keep it logical but it's incredibly draining and I am almost always fatiqued. I live in Sweden, the queues are long and it's understaffed.",concur
"Throw away account

Location: CO Crime: TN

So my son (12) lives with me majority of the year and visits his dad on some school breaks. It came to light recently that during one of his recent visits his stepmom made him undress while she checked his privates for ticks touching him and moving it around. When he asked why he couldn’t do it himself She claimed he was too young to check himself but he has no developmental delays nor has he hit puberty (so no dark pubic hair to have to look around) he is 100% capable of performing a check by himself or requesting his dad to help him. 

This made him extremely uncomfortable. He’s always had anxiety about going to the doctor because he doesn’t like being checked by a medical professional and I haven’t seen him naked in years. (Out of respect for him and his wishes) he said she’s done it before and she will touch him to look all around. I think this has subconsciously turned into his fear of the doctor looking at his privates. 

A psychologist made a report locally when he mentioned it and I received a call from CPS asking about custody and when she heard dad lived in a different state they told me they’d look into it further and get back to me. They told me today they aren’t investigating because it doesn’t meet criteria. They mentioned he had to have marks and bruises and he never mentioned it in the initial report. This makes no sense as this doesn’t seem like the tell tale signs of sexual assault nor was he ever given an exam. I think it’s because they don’t want to cross state lines. They told me to make a report with the Tennessee county or call their police to file a report. I’m just worried it will make me look like that “crazy ex” and turn into me losing custody. 

His dad has dragged me through court. I have filed contempt once this entire time (9 years divorced) after he went 3 years without paying support and I was drowning in debt from childcare costs without his help. I do not constantly file but I’m sincerely concerned for my son and what the judge will think of me. I can’t watch my son have to go to his dads even more than he does now. This isn’t the only issue. He constantly has anxiety about visits (sick and misses school and sleeps with me and cries) and his dad verbally and emotionally abuses him, makes him do physical training as punishment and alienates. None of this stuff (though reported by teachers, doctors, therapists etc) ever turn into anything. I feel like it’s bad but not bad enough for them to care. 

Stepmom was founded of assault on her child a few years ago (I think 7) she and my son have always been at odds (she’s jealous of the attention dad gives him and he feels her resentment and Hatred when he’s there). 

Note: I do have a lawyer and she’s looking into options and what our next steps can be.  I’m looking to see if I’m overreacting or if I need to pursue this harshly in courts and with their state CPS. I am gauging if it seems concerning and classified as sexual assault or not. I can’t be “that mom” with a personal agenda and risk my son’s safety even further. Obviously young children need help checking for ticks but I feel stepmom overstepped due to my son’s age and it making him feel uncomfortable.

"My wife and I have been living together for over a year, but there are some serious problems:

	•	We’ve never had sex. She doesn’t let me touch her sensitive areas, and she doesn’t touch me either. But she always plays with my nipples. Every time I try to touch her, she slaps or claws me badly. She doesn’t even kiss me anymore or let me kiss her.
	•	Before we moved in together, we talked about finances. We agreed to split rent 50/50, I would pay all the bills, and groceries would be split 50/50. But recently, she refused to contribute to the joint account, saying I eat too much (obviously, as men, we tend to eat more than women). She also refused to help me load groceries into the car.

	•	A few days ago, she refused to do the dishes. We had agreed that one person cooks and the other washes dishes. She told me she was going to the gym and would wash the dishes when she got back. But instead, she came home and started yelling at me, asking why I was playing video games instead of washing the dishes.

	•	Every Sunday we clean the house together, but last Sunday I went out for an hour to grab food for us. When I came back, she had gone shopping for her skincare stuff. She was gone for five hours, and I ended up cleaning the whole house by myself.

	•	Every time I try to talk to her about these problems, she says, “Why don’t you wear a skirt? You act like a f***ing girl.”

	•	Every time I want to hang out with my friends, I invite her, but she always refuses to go.

	•	When we go out to eat, I always have to pay for everything.

"I am writing this to just share what I have still in my heart. 

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down. Anyways, I was a fighter and got to know that it has higher chances of survival so I fought and finally I won Cancer in Dec if 2018 itself. Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it. 

So, now while I have recovered and doing all well, It broke me. My mind is not as sharp as it was. I am always angry, frustrated, mean and need support for decisions. It broke me! I am not what I was earlier and may never be.

"I'm 24 and just about to graduate with a Zoology degree. I currently have no college debt and after I complete my upcoming and final semester, I will have 3.5 years of chapter 35 left to spend. 

I was pushed by my parents to follow my dream of being a zoologist and I did so without really thinking about how realistic it would be for me to find employment with livable wages. I'm a myopic person and I know I should have realized my career outlook sooner and thought carefully about my life before jumping into it all. Now I'm trying to find the best career path that would realistically set me up for employment and give me a livable wage that would allow me to at least enjoy life like living in California (i love the ocean and terrain), traveling every few years, being able to afford some games now and then. As of now, my instinct is to jump ship once I graduate and move into CS. I have little experience with coding myself, only somewhat familiar with JS and Python from the handful of coding classes I have taken. 

My ultimate question is CS still worth pursuing in 2025? I know the answer would have been an astounding yes 15 years ago, but things have apparently changed. I've heard nothing but horror stories: people are applying to 500 different jobs and only getting a handful of interviews only to be denied, there's more CS graduates than there are jobs, AI is on the brink of replacing beginner level coders. All of the negativity that surrounds this field makes me feel like it wouldn't be even worth it. Not to mention that I am 24. I would be competing with people who started there CS journey in their preteens. The odds just seem stacked against me.

Are the negative outlooks in this field true? Is it really that doomed of a field? A VERY LARGE part of me says yes and that I should read the writing on the wall but another part of me is thinking that maybe all of the negativity that surrounds this field are from the few people who are unlucky and vocal about their unsuccess. My biggest fear right now is that I am letting the negativity that people have for this field get to me when in fact I could be pursuing it and getting a stable job in a few years. 

","So the CS market got walloped because in 2022 Meta and Amazon and Google decided to stop hoarding talent and laid off \~30,000 very good, experienced software people.

"I’ve posted like a hundred times, but my mom (59) had fallen on June 9th and has tibial plateau surgery the next day. she also fractured her ankle. she’s been bedridden mostly ever since since it’s a non weight bearing break. In the last week she’s definitely been more awake and alert, but her muscles are definitely deconditioning. She’s likely mild-moderate and still has some nueroplasticity in her, she can learn through repetition, but she hasn’t been sleeping well through the night which is making it harder for her to follow through on exercises and such. It’s so hard. We’re trying our best to get her to be able to walk again at some point and she wants to so bad, and it’s hard to see her not want to or be unable to participate. And I can’t even figure out what the problem is. Can she not tell which leg she can use? Is she scared to hurt herself? Is the movement painful? Is she too tired to understand? I’m not sure. But it’s hard. I want her to walk again so bad and she does too, and it’s hard to see her like this. Her 6 week xray is on Wednesday and we’re told the ankle cast will likely come off, and if her knee is healing well we may get cleared for partial weight bearing or a hinge brace to start some movement, and I m scared. I don’t know if it will help. I don’t know if she’ll walk again. I for so long felt in my bones she would, and I still feel like that, but right now I feel defeated. I feel like she isn’t or can’t try hard enough to help us get her there. And she’s incredibly upset at being bedbound. She hates the depends. She wants to use a bathroom. She wants to go to bed upstairs and take a shower. She wants to go to the grocery store with my dad. And I want all these for her. And I don’t know how to get her there anymore. ","I'm so sorry.

"We built NeuralOS, probably the world's most expensive operating system, running at a blazing 1.8fps on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. 😅

**What exactly is NeuralOS?**

It's an experimental generative OS that predicts every screen frame entirely from your mouse and keyboard inputs. No internet, no traditional software stack, purely hallucinated pixels.

**How does it work?**

* An RNN tracks the computer state (kind of like a traditional OS kernel, but all neural and continuous).
* A diffusion model generates the actual screen images (imagine a desktop environment, but fully neural-rendered).

The GIF shows a funny demo: NeuralOS running NeuralOS inside itself. Every single pixel you're seeing is model-generated, no network involved at all!

Long-term, our goal is to remove boundaries between software entirely and make OS fully customizable beyond fixed menus and options. Imagine asking your OS something like:

* ""Merge all my messaging apps into one interface.""
* ""Make Signal look like Messenger.""
* ""Turn the movie I'm watching into a playable video game.""

**I'm curious about your thoughts:**

* Could future OS interfaces just become human-like avatars (think Grok's Ani)? Are menus and app-specific UIs going away?
* What about fully generative games: could diffusion-based games eventually replace traditional ones?

"Not about OLD for once ;), but about flirting out there — in the wild. 

I read in Logan Ury's book, that you should try to get in the mindset of, ""Always be flirting,"" (obviously this is within reason and not being weird or creepy if someone is distant or uninterested). But I realize like most people who are mainly on OLD to date, that my flirting with strangers is rustyyy. 

I am quite a bubbly and outgoing person and I love a playful flirt with a good friend where we've already identified our boundaries clearly, but I realize am a bit stumped at how to flirt out in the wild. 

Case in point:

Went to a bar last week. A guy was behind us in the queue as we just got in before him, so I playfully turned around and grinned and said, ""Guess we got in before you!"" and he laughed and grinned back and said, ""Guess you did!"". Then I was totally clueless as to how to carry on the convo, so my flirting skills in person are rusty as fuck.

Thanks, fellow single friends! ","Funny, my experience of OLD is that no one actually wants to date. Flirting in the wild is easy, just start talking to the person next to you like you would if you were greeting your oldest friend. Bring them into your world by speaking to them with the assumption that they’re gonna be on the same page as you. Most strangers wanna play, even if it’s only for the conversation you’re speaking. If you think they’re cute and wanna flirt, compliment them. Become invested in any passing thing they bring up. You’re playing too. People are extremely receptive to this.

But, no matter how many times I explained this to the nurse, she kept bringing up burning sensations being normal for some chemo drugs. She didn't seem to want to hear ""there's no burning sensation.""

Her ""solutions"" were 1)add saline to the mix, 2)add a much lower volume of saline to the mix, and 3)add a second line in my other hand, in about the same spot as the line that's giving me problems, and run different drugs in there.

She got annoyed and left, with a parting ""I'll come back when you've decided what you want to do"", when I wouldn't let her do 3.

This is a very vulnerable post, again. I’m sharing it because I’m genuinely hoping for support and thoughtful feedback. If this isn’t something you feel you can engage with kindly, I’d appreciate it if you just keep it to yourself.

I connected with someone on Hinge earlier this year. At first it felt like a surprisingly emotionally honest connection — messaging that didn’t feel shallow or performative. It wasn’t slow, exactly, but it felt different. There was mutual care and attentiveness, and I hadn’t experienced that kind of emotional safety in 36 years.

We never met in person or called, but it felt like something was being built between us. I wasn’t trying to push for more. I was just showing up, and for a while, she was too.

Then out of nowhere, she told me someone close to her had died. I hadn’t known she was going through anything like that. It shifted things. Not long after, she started pulling away. Eventually, she sent a message saying she still needed space — but also said goodbye. The message was confusing. Was it space or was it an ending? I haven’t known how to process it.

Since then, I’ve struggled with a lot — including intense dissociation and suicidal thoughts. I’ve had a really hard time making sense of how something that felt emotionally safe and meaningful could touch something real deep and then just be gone.

And it’s not just this. This past year alone I’ve lost my religious identity, my sense of self shaped by that for 36 years, my relationship with my family, and am still grieving my dad, who was my closest friend, and who I lost about 6 years ago. I also grew up in a cult, and I’m just trying to find a way to heal. This isn’t even an eighth of what’s gone on lately.

I’ve even given advice to others before about heartbreak and grief and timing. But being on this side of it — where it hits your nervous system and your sense of meaning and safety all at once — I’ve just felt completely unmoored. I guess I’m just reaching out. Has anyone else been through something like this — where a connection touched something real deep and then it was just gone?","Yo this sounds a lot bigger than just a relationship ending.

"My long covid experience started about 8 months ago. Prior to that I was at peak physical fitness and mental health. I did not receive the vaccines and had covid once in 2021 for about a week which didn't seem to affect me afterwards. 

I was celibate since 2016 up until November and had a short term and very emotionally stressful relationship. Long distance. We met and she stayed here for almost two weeks. I feel a lot of grief because I started feeling sick about 10 days after she was here and believe intimate contact was the cause. 

I was very stressed for a few months and lost my ability to sleep and need to take remeron and trazedone to help. Some nights I still can't sleep. Went about two months without sleeping at my previous job. Would just lay there as the time passed. 

I probably have mcas. My body can't tolerate weed or alcohol anymore. My skin became thinner and stretchy all over. My eyes are still red all the time and can get better or worse throughout the day. I'm 35 and look young for my age but this is difficult to deal with.

My pupils can be different sizes especially at night. Usually not in the morning but it happens more in dim lighting. Eye doctor gaslit me saying it is nornal. My astigmatism also got worse and had new lenses out into my glasses.

I went to the gym every day previously. It was my favorite thing to do. My heart rate was in the 50s and now it's usually 80-100. I was laid off of my last job due to having panic attacks throughout this season and it affected my performance. I honestly didn't think I'd be able to work again but found anotner similar job. 

Not knowing what happened to my body or if it will improve or get worse really affects my quality of life. God also gave me many warning signs not to get involved in that relationship. I live alone and had a very peaceful life the last 5 years. I feel anxious all the time and am not sure what to do really. 

It doesn't feel like it has gotten worse but only time will tell. I just wish I could have my old life back where I was so focused on enjoying other things. Documentaries and podcasts and music. Since this happened I've been seeing more and more stuff about long covid when I didn't before. So much grief because I wanted to stay healthy and the information would have kept me on a smart path. I didn't consider that exposing myself to someone for almost two weeks would get me sick since they didn't seem to be sick at the time. The stress and emotional abuse probably made it worse.

Once the divorce was over I felt major relief. 6 months ahead and I get struck with covid and I did not even know at that time it was. I tested 3 times at home and it kept coming up as negative. And I had a lingering cough for 2 weeks. During this time was when all my symptoms starting coming up and I've probably had somewhere between 30-40 and possibly more. I'm at 6 months now and alot of my symptoms have either resolved or are resolving. I have about 6-8 symptoms left now. I got sick probably from one of my friends who was sick and due to the chronic stress from my previous relationship, covid was just fuel to the fire.

"This is a personal side project I've been working on exploring the potential of small segment-anything models - [https://github.com/Krasner/edgesam-dyt](https://github.com/Krasner/edgesam-dyt)

I was inspired by [EdgeSAM ](https://github.com/chongzhou96/EdgeSAM)and their method to distill the original SAM ViT model. Having tried EdgeSAM for my own on-the-edge applications I found the segmentation masks to be highly sensitive to quantization precision - specifically the LayerNorms.

A recent paper [Transformers without Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622) proposed replacing layernorms with dynamic tanh layers. My goal was to modify the EdgeSAM architecture and retrain completely without any layernorms.

In the repo I provide the step-by-step method for distillation and retraining, as well as checkpoints that I was able to achieve. This is done in 3 distillation steps as described in the repo README.

Inspired by [HQ-SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01567) I also modified the RepViT (what EdgeSAM is based on) image encoder to extract 3 intermediate that can be used in the HQ version of the mask decoder - then distill from the HQ-SAM ViT-H checkpoint. This improves results in some conditions.

Ultimately, I am fairly compute restricted and could only train with moderate batch sizes so the results are not optimal. Let me know if anyone is interested in collaborating to improve these results, train on better hardware, or has some ideas as to how to resolve a few issues I had (outlined in the repo).

I provide gradio web demos in the repo for the base and hq versions of EdgeSAM-DyT, as well as ONNX checkpoint and code for both versions. I also have TensorRT implementations that I am able to run locally (after generating trt engines). I can provide code on request.","Thanks! I performed distillation similar to the EdgeSAM method but because I replaced layernorms with DyT I had to do more training. While DyT layers can replace layernorms I don't believe it is a drop-in / direct replacement. At least in my experiments I was not able to freeze the rest of the models and only train DyT layers. This was more evident with the Mask Decoder which needed a lot of retraining. (suprisingly so). So my 3 steps of distillation were: 1. Only distill the image encoder (repvit model with DyT layer rather then layernorms) with MSE loss to ViT-H embeddings. This is exactly what EdgeSAM does. 2. Prompt-in-the-loop training (this is the main contribution of EdgeSAM). Once step 1 is done, the distilled embeddings are still not correct since MSE loss is not sufficient to train the image encoder. So they use the standard SAM mask decoder (frozen) and continue training the image encoder with sigmoidCE and Dice losses on the inferred masks. Masks are produced either with a bounding box or point prompt - and in the paper they also have multiple prompts per training sample. This is reflected in the \`ITER\_ON\_BOX\` and \`POINTS\_PER\_REFINE\_ITER\` configs. They show that adding more prompts disambiguates the query to the mask decoder making the masks more precise. So in my step 2 - I continue training the image encoder with the original mask decoder frozen (with layernorms). 3. This is my add-on - I want to replace layernorms in the mask decoder with DyT layers. At this point I assume the image encoder is good enough and freeze it. Then I retrain the mask decoder fully unfrozen with DyT layers. To my surprise this was a lot more difficult than expected - I needed many iterations of training with a decently high learning rate to get the mask predictions to be correct. Initially I did step 2 and 3 together - i.e I trained the image encoder and the mask decoder with DyT layers jointly. But that lead to really poor learning - this prompted me to train the DyT mask decoder in step 3. The optional step 4 is leveraging some of the techniques of HQ-SAM - i.e extracting low level features from the image encoder, adding an hq\_token to the mask decoder and then refining the original generated masks with those intermediate features. This adds only a few extra layers into the mask decoder submodel which I again train with DyT. This also was more challenging than expected but certainly has an impact on the mask quality. Steps 1-3 I trained on 5% of SA-1B dataset. Step 4 is trained on HQSeg-44k like HQ-SAM. I do find that that dataset is limited and I had to change the prompting strategy - so it is a bit different than that used in HQ-SAM. Anyways, if you have any ideas or questions I am open to collaborate and brainstorm.",concur
"hi everyone. my grandma has late stage alzheimers (can't talk, doesn't recognize her children). she is in an assisted living facility, but my mom frequently visits her. i can no longer bear to visit her because it is so hard seeing someone i once new in an unrecognizable state (so i cant even imagine what its like for my mom). anyways, my mom has also become unrecognizable since the diagnosis. my relationship with her has deteriorated, and she just never seems happy. I am so scared of this happening to my mom. I don't really understand the genetics of Alzheimer's, but I know it is genetic? My great grandfather had it as well, and I guess passed it down to his daughter (my grandma). I cant stop thinking about possibly being in my mom's position in 25 something years (I'm currently 15, mom is 51). even worse, i cant think about my mom being in my grandmas position.

"I (30f) am dating someone (35m) exclusively and am contending with 2 big things - my divorce (final court date tbd) and his travel schedule (1-3 weeks per month, usually a couple days to a week between trips). We've been exclusive for about a month. Since neither of us is wild about the term gf/bf, and that seems too soon, it feels like our relationship is sort of on pause then fully back on when he's in town. My female friends all think this is a plus since he and I are in weird personal circumstances and have been really open with communication/support. My male friends have been throwing in pretty judgemental/contentious questions and discussions of red flags (for instance, how we text each other and how often; that I'd taken the lead in the define the relationship talk; the importance of letting a guy pursue you; him not being who they imagined for me - he's an athletic quiet guy whereas I usually go for lanky charismatic guys - kind of touchy stuff since my exes have leaned toward the possessive/jealous type and were sort of sad boy nerd musicians).

I feel positive about my relationship overall. I have my weaker moments, like before a trip where I worry about missing him too intensely or when he gets back and I feel nervous like we're going to have to start all over again. But when we're in person I feel connected, and when we're apart and I'm in a good headspace I feel equally excited and comfortable about having him in my life. We're both serious, private people and have each been in 1 LTR. We still find a lot of levity and spark together (laughing and sex have been particularly helpful to me right now in a way that dating around, worrying about putting my best foot forward, and swiping through the apps wasn't). Idk if it'll go anywhere, but I'm willing to take that risk. 

So here's the rub. I can't tell if I'm just being overly sensitive about my female v male friends' takes on this relationship. Maybe it boils down to a base difference in how they might act if they were in my/his shoes. I want to continue talking about my dating life with all my friends but am questioning if I need to adjust my boundaries with them or if there's a bigger problem with their motives? I haven't talked to male friends about relationship stuff in years - tbh my ex was always weird about my prior male friendships so I kept in closer contact with mutual male friends (I don't talk to any of them now, womp womp of my marriage ending and impacting my social circle). I don't date male friends or remove them from the friendzone ever (lost a best friend that way years ago). They know this. I guess what I'm trying to get at is: are my guy friends right about this relationship (is it full of red flags) or are they projecting (what they might want with someone, or possibly jealousy because they want that for me)?

"Hello. I am a machine learning student, I have been doing this for a while, and I found a concept called ""transfer learning"" and topics like ""fine tuning"". In short, my dream is to be an ML or AI engineer. Lately I hear that all the models that are arriving, such as Sam Anything (Meta), Whisper (Open AI), etc., are zero-shot models that do not require tuning no matter how specific the problem is. The truth is, I ask this because right now at university we are studying PyTorch and transfer learning. and If in reality it is no longer necessary to tune models because they are zero-shot, then it does not make sense to learn architectures and know which optimizer or activation function to choose to find an accurate model. Could you please advise me and tell me what companies are actually doing? To be honest, I feel bad. I put a lot of effort into learning optimization techniques, evaluation, and model training with PyTorch.","Keep this in mind, fine tuning and transfer learning are taking advantage of an existing model and training it for your specific use case. That’s assuming the model is appropriate for the context. If you try to use these models out of the box for your use case it might do well, or it might not. Many reasons for this, namely the data type, how it was collected and so forth. This is where transfer learning and fine tuning become your friend if you have a dataset or datasets that contain the information you want the model to learn. Transfer learning is used a lot in computer vision, for example. I’m sure others can expound.",concur

1. ""No novelty"" – even when the paper introduces a new idea that beats the state of the art, just because it reuses components from other fields. No one else has achieved these results or approached the problem in the same way. So why dismiss it as lacking novelty?

2. Misunderstanding the content – reviewers asking questions that are already clearly answered in the paper. It feels like the paper wasn’t read carefully, if at all.

Is there a simple way to qualify for hospice with long covid? Besides also having cancer with long covid. Or maybe a disease that one could intentionally contract that will shorten lifetime down to year to qualify?,"I see that anxiety is one of your challenges. Have you read r/histamineintolerance? You may know all about what I’m writing but just in case you don’t….After a lot of food tracking and an elimination diet of foods one by one, I discover what I thought was anxiety that I didn’t use to get was actually a histamine overload. I shifted to a very low histamine diet and didn’t eat foods that had triggered me even if they were listed in a low histamine diet. Not everyone with Long Covid has issues with histamines and or mast cells (rMCAS) but many people do. For me a histamine overload feels like whole body inflammation, sometimes itchy eyes etc, but especially a panic attack feeling. I had to experiment with antihistamines to figure out what helped. Pepcid and an H1. Higher doses than label says. The antihistamines also help some with the systemic inflammation of long Covid. Not eating the foods or taking meds that trigger reactions help the most. Reducing inflammation also reduces pain for many. MCAS, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome is a related set of symptoms some people with long Covid have. One treats it with antihistamines and with mast cells stabilizers of which they are many. Cromolyn and ketofinin are commonly prescribed. You can google or read subreddits to understand more. I’m telling you all this because you mention in your comment history wanting to reduce your dependency on benzos. I recently learned that some benzos are mast cell stabilizers. If mast cells are a contributing cause of your anxiety, take mast cell stabilizers might reduce the anxiety and inflammation, reducing the need for the benzos.

I'm writing here becuase I'm unable to sleep. 

Its been 6 months since my last update, I'm now almost 8 months pregnant and my daughter is 5 now. She is a sweetheart.  

My last months have been rough.  Life is beating me up like if I was the one who stole baby Jesus' pacifier.  

My ex was very respectful the very few weeks. He came regularly to pick our daughter, put his share of money, was attentive with me and I thought whoa, maybe this is going to hurt like hell for a long time but its gonna work. My mom and my sister were great! I swear this pregnancy has been easy, sometimes I forget I'm pregnant. 

I FOUND out the reason of Eliza and ex fallout. And learned it directly from Eliza's mouth. She called me one day and say she would like some words. I wasn't sure but we met. She said she wanted to apologize for a couple of things: not realizing _how_ badly intrusive she was in my marriage (she knew she was but did not realized how bad it was and how toxic). Enjoying the influece she has on my husband. Knowing he would do as she pleased gave her a sense of control she didn't have in her life. And she apologized for all the pain she caused me. 

We are no friends or anything. I'm trying my best to no hate her but I'm glad that finally my feelings and insecurities were validated. 

*On their fallout out* Apparently when my ex was sleeping with a friend, at some point between when he left the house and when he returned begging to save our family; 2 male friends, Eliza and my ex where having drinks, they were drunk but no wasted. Eliza went outside to smoke and my followed her and tried to kiss her, she rejected him, asked what the fuck and my ex went all romantic about the fire he felt for her, he was full of fire for her. It was always her. She laughed and called him patetic. 

She told me that so I know exactly what kind man he is. 

Now the rough part, after a couple of weeks he started to press again for being together. One day he was being so agresive about it that when I said I would die first before being with him he grabbed me by my arm  and left a mark. 

He basically disappeared. He isnt helping with child support and I'm alone paying for everything.  I'm really struggling.

He finally got up the courage and tremblingly spoke to us, and then broke down in heavy tears when we told him it was okay, that college isn't the only way, and it will all figure it out together, as long as he was safe. 

We used our connections and was able to get him a position at a local company nearby, making a surprisingly generous hourly wage for a first job. Our AC has worked there for less than 2 weeks, spend some time with some peers after work the other day, and then message desk saying he was calling in sick the next day and would it be okay if he just quit that job and went to therapy instead. 

I told him that therapy is absolutely 100% always a go, but that we would need to discuss quitting. I've been trying to figure out what to say because I'm feeling like this is how 50-year-old adults who never left their parents house start. But I know that's an unkind thing to say. 

 I want to let him know that him getting this position was a unicorn because most people out there are having trouble finding jobs as it is, let it go let alone the cushy high paying one we were able to get him.

TLDR: adult son quit college, was handed a job, wants to quit the job, and now I'm looking advice on how to give him gentle but also tough love","hey, autistic 23 year old here! i'm literally only like 50 pages into the book, but ""the autistic burnout workbook"" by dr megan anna neff has already changed SO much for me. i gushed about it in therapy for the whole hour, saying that after a lifetime of having absolutely 0 idea how to ever get better after trying SO hard, i FINALLY see a way out. i knew there must be a solution, but all the traditional advice i tried that you give to classically depressed people worsened my condition and made me feel broken. my therapist found a lot of passages informative and poignant! he's got to be dealing with autistic burnout. where most get burnt out on a job or in school and can blow off steam doing different activities, autistic people essentially get burnt out on being alive. when we burn out, our skills regress a lot. when i'm stressed enough about whatever led me into burnout, i literally can't eat anything besides microwaved meals or prepacked food. i am attempting to navigate this 😅 the way the book is laid out, you learn what autistic burnout is, what it DOES, and that you're not alone. you learn to recognize what burnout feels like for YOU, and how to recognize it coming. you learn how to recognize internal markers (how do you feel leading up to it?) and external markers (what are some noticeable behaviors others may catch onto?). it then gives a bunch of chapters of, to me, mindblowing advice and a plan for recovery that i never could have conceptualized on my own. a job is an unfortunately necessary part of life. you are absolutely right in wanting him to have the strength to do things he HAS to do. i like this book because it lays things out very clearly and thoroughly, in a way autistic people tend to understand. what skills he needs to be given, right now, are the skills to navigate autistic burnout. he CANNOT become a shut in, you're correct, but simply pushing harder ALWAYS makes the burnout worse. for the sake of clarity, i honestly really recommend this book. it gives you an actual personalized plan of action rooted in understanding yourself and learning to take care of your needs without crashing and burning. i'm not affiliated or anything, pirate it for all i care! but for me, it's made me feel SO rooted after a lifetime of feeling like i could NEVER be what i had to be to survive in this world. off the top of my head, maybe decreasing his hours on the next available schedule is a possibility? it's GREAT to have a place to HAVE to be, and have a routine. but he will also need to conserve energy to invest in creating this plan of action to take care of himself in times like this. autistic burnout is inevitable unfortunately, but the right tools make ALL the difference.",concur
"She’s in a long-term relationship, and he originally had a crush on her but ended up making out with me the night all three of us met.

For a month, he tried to get me out on a date and I refused every time because he seemed opportunistic. Meanwhile, he was also talking to her (not sure why she entertained it given her relationship).

I finally gave in once and went on a date with him—not because I wasn’t aware of the circumstances, but because he seemed nice and we have good banter. I let her know we had a great time, and she seemed quite happy about it.

Fast forward to last week, I was on vacation when she sent a selfie of both of them in a friend group chat. She sensed my salty reaction, and then she messaged me privately saying they only met by accident and were together for about an hour.

I came back from vacation, met him, and brought it up. He gave me a different story—they actually agreed to meet and were together the whole time.

Honestly, I feel like going out with him was just an experiment to see how far he would go, and now I’ve learned I bargained for more than I expected. He was never going to be loyal, but neither was she.

"I just watched something that completely changed how I think about ApoE4 and Alzheimer's risk.

For years, we've been told that carrying ApoE4 means one thing: dramatically higher Alzheimer's risk. Period. End of story.

But what if that's only half true?

Dr. Aura Ramirez just presented research that shows ApoE4 behaves COMPLETELY differently depending on your ancestry. Not just ""a little different""—we're talking about fundamental molecular changes in how the gene functions.

Here's what blew my mind:

🧬 **Discovery #1: African ancestry contains a ""genetic brake"" that naturally suppresses ApoE4 expression.** When researchers used CRISPR to remove this brake, ApoE4 expression shot up, but ONLY in African cells. European cells? No change.



🧠 **Discovery #2: In European and African brains, ApoE4 creates a dangerous imbalance:** ramping up cholesterol production while shutting down myelin (the insulation that keeps your neurons firing properly). It's like building more gas stations while letting the highways crumble.



🌎 **Discovery #3: Amerindian brain cells flip the entire script.** Their ApoE4 actually REDUCES cholesterol pathways and INCREASES myelination. Same gene, opposite effect.



**This is both fascinating science AND hope.**

Because if some populations have naturally evolved protection against ApoE4, maybe we can learn to replicate it. Maybe risk isn't as fixed as we thought. Maybe your genes aren't your destiny after all.

I've been diving deep into this research, and just posted a full breakdown on YouTube.

**If you carry ApoE4, or care about someone who does, this might be the most important 15 minutes you spend today. Remember to share it if you believe it might help someone else!**

Because the more we understand about how ancestry shapes genetic risk, the closer we get to truly personalized prevention.

"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.

"Nobody is truly ‘in denial’ about their substance use. People might lie about their drug/alcohol intake in order to avoid judgment or legal repercussions, but that’s not being ‘in denial’; they’re in touch with the reality of what/how much they use, and they’re lying about it. There’s a a difference between conscious deception and unconscious self-deception. 

When people have nothing to lose from acknowledging their drug use—if they won’t get judged or punished for their honesty—then they’ll be honest about it. People make honest posts about their substance use all the time right here on r/addiction. 

So what’s the deal with ‘denial’? The concept of ‘denial’ in addiction all about **delegitimizing a person’s self-assessment of their drug use**: If you assess their use as ‘problematic’ and they disagree with your assessment, we call that ‘denial’ even though it’s really a difference of opinion. 

A wife tells her husband he’s an ‘addict’ because he drinks and smokes weed every day. The husband doesn’t deny that he drinks and smokes weed; he just disagrees with his wife about how problematic it is. Maybe we’re inclined to side with his wife, because maybe (we think) she has very good reasons for saying it’s a problem. But agreeing with the wife doesn’t turn her opinion into a transcendental truth that *everyone* must agree with, otherwise they are ‘in denial.’ It doesn’t negate her husband’s right to view his drug use differently. 

I understand the impulse to slap the ‘denial’ label on a person who lost their job for showing up drunk, who says “I’m not an alcoholic” or “it’s not a problem.” It’s hard to build a bridge of understanding across such a great chasm of value differences. The idea that “keeping your job is more important than getting drunk” is so deeply ingrained in most of us that we treat it like an absolute truth. So, we assume that anybody who doesn’t share this value is out-of-touch with reality…’in denial.”

But here’s what works better than accusing them of ‘denial’: 

* Providing them with a safe space to be honest about their drug use. 
* Making a genuine effort to understand how *they* define problematic use. 
* Encouraging them to reflect on *their* values and priorities surrounding substance use. 

If we do all of the above, maybe they still won’t self-identify as an ‘alcoholic/addict’ or go to treatment. Maybe they’ll keep drinking the same as before, if they truly think it’s worth losing jobs over…and we have to accept that, because they have the right to live in accordance with their own values. We can only choose to distance ourselves from them if we can’t tolerate their lifestyle. 

Or, maybe they will decide for themselves (after some reflection) that the pleasure of intoxication wasn’t worth the pain of losing their job, and they’ll make different choices from now on. 

Regardless of the outcome, accusing the person of denial doesn’t help. It doesn’t make the ‘good’ outcome more likely. It doesn’t make the ‘bad’ outcome less likely. It’s really just a form of gaslighting. It’s arrogant. It’s dishonouring their perspective. It destroys rapport. That’s why the word ‘denial’ should stay out of our vocabulary when we’re talking about addiction. ","Well said. Also, it's still part of the treatment paradigm to use guilt and shame as a ""motivator"" to stop using. It doesn't work, it's not productive. Imagine if we shamed people for having schizophrenia. Shit, if it's a disease (I believe it is), imagine guilting someone for having cancer. There's really not that much or any difference.

"A week ago, my father died by suicide, and it's turned my world upside down. He was my rock and the person I loved most in the world.

For some back story, my parents had a toxic relationship my whole life, they were married for a few months and divorced a month before I was born, constantly in custody battles, and often used me to hurt each other. I was exposed to a lot of mental manipulation from both sides, but especially from my mom.

Since my dad’s passing, my mom says I can talk to her about how I'm feeling, but when I do, she reacts in really uncomfortable ways. She’ll say things like, ""You still have your mom,"" or ""I'm not dead yet,"" or she’ll roll her eyes and avoid sitting with me when I ask to talk. If I don’t talk, she gets upset. If I do talk, she gets offended. It's like I'm walking on eggshells no matter what.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

How do I protect my emotional space while still living with her? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of complicated parent relationship while grieving? I am so grateful for any advice.

"Abstract:  
Following infection with SARS-CoV-2, patients may experience with one or more symptoms that appear or persist over time. Neurological symptoms associated with long COVID include anxiety, depression, and memory impairment. However, the exact underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Using golden hamsters as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persistently infect the brain, as viral RNA and replicative virus are detected in the brainstem 80 days after the initial infection. Infected hamsters exhibit a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, characterized by overexpression of innate immunity genes, and altered expression of genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, in energy metabolism, and in proteostasis. These infected animals exhibit persistent depression-like behavior, impaired short-term memory, and late-onset signs of anxiety. Finally, we provide evidence that viral and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, contributing to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.

Its been stressful but not bad, but the realization kind of hit me that its going to be like this for the next two years, and even when she comes back to the US to do her PhD, it'll still be long distance because she'll likely be in another state far from me. 

I just can't do it anymore, the way I travel is stressful, the lack of basic intimacy like hugs and kisses and closeness. Add on top of that the fact that I'll have much busier schedule these next 4 or so years, I don't think I can handle it.

"look i'm not a therapist or anything, just figured out something that helped my mental health and maybe it'll help someone else. If this sounds dumb, it probably is and sorry in advance.

I used to think being accountable to myself meant being harsh. like if i wasn't being ""productive"" or doing well mentally, i needed to track everything and push harder. but that just made me feel worse about myself most of the time.

the problem was tracking the wrong things. I was obsessing over streaks and consistency instead of paying attention to how things actually made me feel like for example i'd force myself to meditate for 20 minutes daily to keep my streak alive even when 5 minutes felt better. or i'd scroll social media then beat myself up about it instead of understanding why i was doing it.

So i switched it up to tracking three simple things for activities that are supposed to help my mental health: how calm i feel (1-10), how present I was (1-10), and how ready i feel to tackle things (1-10). that's it. no streaks, no guilt if i miss days.

what i love is it's not about being perfect instead it's about being curious. some days i take great breaks and feel amazing. other days i doom-scroll for 20 minutes and rate it a 2 for restoration. both are valuable because they build self-awareness about what actually helps my mental state versus what i think should help.

the funny thing is understanding my patterns without judgment made me naturally choose better habits. when you see that 10-minute walks consistently rate 8/10 but scrolling rates 3/10, the choice becomes obvious.

Being kind to yourself doesn't mean giving up on self-care, it means building awareness about what actually helps your mental health and choosing those things more often.

The nurse came today to fill us in on the plan for in-home OT, PT, Nurse, etc -  and it will all be covered by Medicare - except of course a daily home aid (what I'm doing). I asked the nurse what that would cost and he said it's $45 per hour.

His wife had previously offered to pay me $100 per week for two days, so that's essentially $50 per day. But then it turned out they'll need me 5 days a week. Some of you suggested no less than $50/day. Many of you suggested much more for the entire week. I was actually considering staying at $100, maybe $150 per week. But today I decided if she was okay with $50 per day for two days, she should be okay with $50 per day in general, right?

So that's what I asked for, $50 per day which would be $250 per week. I had previously told her I cannot do weekends, as I'll need to rest and recover, and also because she runs around shopping for clothes and does lunch with friends all weekend, so it's hardly a necessity. 

I DO realize the amount is very low, but it even asking for that much was incredibly difficult for me and that amount will help me make ends meet and will be beneficial.

She looked like she was going to pass out, and then said ""That's $250 a week"". I said ""Yes, but here's the brochure for the home-aid place, they would charge you $1,575.00 per week. You would pay them for one hour what you'd pay me for the whole day.

So her next two comments are still puzzling me, but I'm overtired so maybe I'm missing something. First she said ""But I would be paying you myself, not from your father's account"". They keep separate bank accounts but she is listed on his accounts as a joint holder, so I really don't know what the issue is or what she was implying. She has access to both their accounts but he doesn't have access to hers, by their own weird mutual agreement. I honestly still don't know what her point was or what that has to do with me but she seemed to be implying something.  
  
I just said ""I guess you'll have to work that out with him, I'm not sure how you guys want to handle it"". She seemed to be saying she should pay less because SHE is paying me as opposed to HIM? But he's her husband, not mine, so the comment was confusing. Thoughts?

The second thing she said confused me even more, which was ""But can you work Saturdays?"" I said ""No, remember, I can't work the weekends, I will need to rest"". And she said ""But who will watch your father? I want to work overtime so I can pay you."" I said ""But you'd have to pay me for coming on a Saturday, so what would be the point?"" and she was quiet. I think she wanted me to work Saturdays for free so she could do overtime??? I'm honestly not sure. Like I said in my post last night, she will absolutely push me and take what she can. I sensed some sort of manipulation attempt but just shut down any idea of weekends.

I drove home thinking about how little $50 per day is for what the time investment and the level of care I'd be giving and felt less and less guilty. That works out to $7.14/hr which is less than minimum wage in my state and that's before the gas I'd have to use for the 2 hour drive each day. She's getting a bargain for bleep's sake.

She has a huge family who all help each other out and I am my father's only family. I guess if she doesn't like it, she can get one of her many family members to come do it for cheaper - but I highly doubt anyone would.

I would not have asked for even that small amount if it weren't for the supportive and encouraging comments last night in this sub. I have no family or support so it meant the world to me. Thank you.","In your prior post you wrote: >In the past I've been a terrible people-pleaser/doormat AND my father and his wife have both taken advantage of that ... She will push my limits so I want to go into this feeling like there's a fair arrangement for myself too, for once. You are setting up a horrible situation for yourself. I hope you take some time and rethink it. Tell your father's wife she needs to arrange this type of care with a professional agency. The cost is astounding, but that is not a reason for you to become indentured in this way. Do not start. It sounds like you do not know how to extricate yourself from being manipulated in this way.",concur
"For years, my identity was a graveyard of brilliant careers I could have had. The Substack founder, the AI-tool tinkerer, the artist with a pottery wheel still in its box.

I was addicted to the dopamine of planning. It felt like progress, but it was just a risk-free fantasy. The imagined version of me is a flawless writer; the real me faces a blinking cursor and crippling self-doubt.

I finally realized I wasn't scared of failing. I was scared the messy, imperfect *process* would ruin the perfect *idea* of me. This hit me hard. My entire self-worth was tied to a fantasy.

The shift wasn't about finding more motivation. It was a conscious change in tactics. **Here is the practical framework I used:**

1. **The Goal is the Action, Not the Outcome.** Stop trying to ""become a painter."" The only goal is to ""paint for 15 minutes today."" Showing up *is* the win. This immediately shifts you from paralyzed to active.
2. **Give Yourself Permission to Be Bad.** My first goal on the pottery wheel wasn't to make a beautiful bowl, but an ugly one. On purpose. This detached my ego from the outcome and freed me to just touch the clay. It’s about the physical act, not the performance.
3. **Chase Tiny, Unimpressive Progress.** Forget the high of some future success. Learn to love the small wins. The moment my focus shifted from ""becoming a ceramicist"" to ""this handle is slightly less wobbly than the last one,"" everything changed. That’s the new reward.

The ghosts of my potential selves are still around, but they don't haunt me anymore. I’m learning that the most impressive thing I can build isn't a flawless future in my head.

It’s a real, messy, tangible today.",This reads like AI.,oppose

"It happened.

I had met the girl of my dreams.

So I had thought.

We met at a military ball, she thought I was cute and gave me her number, and we started dating shortly after. We went a few months together, and we were already sure we were each other's person. We were planning on marriage (not at that moment but eventually), she said she saw me as someone she wanted to spend her life with. To have kids with. To grow old together. We lost our virginity to each other even.

The relationship was good overall, we were there for each other, there were some bumps, but I made sure to communicate. She had issues being expressive or giving effort into the relationship at times due to past trauma. It was one sided emotionally and effort-wise, with me giving most/all the effort. That did hurt me, and we did have conversations where she expressed that I deserved better. Still though, it was something I was willing to work with her on, and she was showing signs of improvement. That was really all ""wrong"" with our relationship. That and my mom didn't approve of her, something that hurt my ex very much. But still.

We were both planning on doing the military together. I had already enlisted, she was going to enlist next year, and we would be co located eventually after marrying. We were confident we could handle the struggle of a military relationship. She stressed she wouldn't quit, that I was worth it, that we could do it. I believed her.

A week or two ago, my gut told me she was getting ready to break up. I always get a vibe, and it's NEVER been wrong. I expressed this concern to her, and I made sure she still wanted me in her future. She assured me. I still felt though things were off.

Last night, we said goodnight. She said she'd talk to me tomorrow, that she misses me, and that she loves me. Then an hour after that (when she supposedly went to sleep), she sent me the text. Here it is:

""So, this sucks because I really hate that I’m doing this to you, but I also admit I’m a coward who doesn’t have the balls to say this shit to your face. Uhh, I’m going to end things for us, I think that this is better for us because there’s just a lot of collision in our relationship that isn’t working for me. You’ve been wonderful, amazing, kind, like don’t get me wrong you’re literally perfect. And I don’t mean to do the cliche ‘it’s not you it’s me’ thing but it literally is. I can’t communicate, I can’t provide, I’m not good for you. I’m a really terrible person and I need to fix that, you deserve more than I was able to offer. Honestly part of me wants you to hate me, blame me, do whatever you can to cope. Uhm, I’m blocking you on everything because I really don’t want you to try and call or text saying we can fix things or whatever. Like my mind is pretty well set on this, it just better this way. I want the best for you, I hope you achieve all your dreams and goals. As much as it doesn’t seem like it, I really do love you. Bye \[my name\].

Then of course, I was blocked on everything. Just out of the blue. Just like that. All that talk. I'll be there for you. I'm not going to quit. You're worth it. Everything down the drain. I had planned my life with this girl, she wanted me to propose this month. The last time we had seen eachother, maybe a few days ago, we had a nice little date that she planned. We hugged and kissed. We talked and laughed. There was no warning besides my gut.

I immediately reached out to her family. Her family loves me, they consider her apart of the family. They expressed their condolences; they're shocked as much as I am. They think that she's in the wrong. They support me.

All I want is to see her and talk to her face to face and resolve this. If things work out, and we're able to fix it, great. If not, I need closure. I need this last face to face to move on. I expressed this to her family and they advised me to give her space for like a week and hope she reached out, and that they would try talking to her in the meantime.

It's the day after the message and I'm still trying to figure this out. I'm in a state of shock. Everything down the drain. For what? Part of me wants to hate her for doing such a scummy move, but I still love her. I want to talk to her. I'm currently giving her space, and waiting as her family helps me through this.

Plot twist though. I had talked to her sisters, and they actually told me that she's been talking to her exes. They broke into her computer and told me they found her flirting with her exes, planning hangouts, venting about our relationship being ""toxic"" and ""drama filled,"" even having her exes send her money. And I knew about none of this. Apparently she texted an ex the moment she dumped me. Her sisters are disgusted, they also loved me, they're assuring me that I dodged a bullet.

I talked to her mom about that, and she said she's not defending my ex, but that there's a good chance it's not true - apparently her sisters like to stir drama. So we'll see I guess. That's something to consider.

Honestly, I'm putting the military on hold now. My ex is what pushed me to go that route anyways, and I turn 18 in less than a month (which be the way we're both 17) so I want time to enjoy life freely. I want to put myself back together before full sending it.

I'm still in a state of shock. I'm numb and have been crying off and on the whole time. I'm just so confused. If she loves me, and I love her, what reason is there to break up? Maybe it's a self esteem issue with the ""you deserve better""? I have no idea. Then there's the whole potential cheating thing.

At the end of the day, all I want is that face to face. I don't intend for her to get away with text breakup, that is not okay. I feel like a shell of what I was. I feel terribly lonely. It hurts extra because I have trauma myself and had insecurities and fears the whole time, she reassured me on those and RIGHT at the moment I fully believed her, that I fully got over my trust issues and trusted her with my life, did she do this.",Agreed. I'm going to write a letter to her saying goodbye and move on.,concur
"I had to go to a work conference last week. Standard networking event with dinner and drinks at one of the nicer hotels in my city. 

I had water and a coffee, didn't drink anything else and didn't eat. People found it odd, but I always make some sort of excuse like I don't trust buffets, cross contamination etc. 

I came home and was still thinking about it. Middle of the night doom scrolling I had a sudden epiphany. I never eat at parties, events, weddings, conferences etc. Ever. It just always feels wrong, like I have to prove that I didn't just show up for the free food. 

Everytime I go to someone's house or any gathering, I always take snacks, drinks, smokes, desserts, or anything they'll enjoy/use. My husband was part of my friend group, and they also noticed that I always brought something whenever I hung out with them. 

Then it hit me why I do this. It was honestly a mindfuck moment. I'm in my 30s and I'm only realising it now, how the fuck. When I was a kid, around 10 years old, I went to a wedding with my family. My parents were close to the bride's parents. My parents and their friends grew up poor, and most of them crawled out of that situation with a lot of effort. 

The food at the wedding was buffet style, and in my country the usual custom is that the caterer will charge per plate that is used. My parents knew this and decided that my entire family (6 people) will only use 2 plates since they knew their friends were struggling with the wedding costs (not eating at all would be considered insulting to the hosts).

I was sent to the buffet with my mother to get the two plates. I was told to get this curry type thing, and it was put on my plate without a bowl, so obviously the thin-ish gravy ran over half the plate (remember I was a child and did not have excellent balance). My mother saw this and reprimanded me saying that now half the plate was already taken and didn't have enough room for much other food. Fine, whatever. But my dad has a temper, we got back and he got this really angry look on his face. By then I was old enough to recognise these signs of danger from his face. I just stayed quiet, put the plate on the table and sat at the farthest chair. He immediately went off about how useless, stupid, idiotic I was and how I had wasted a plate. When he had these fits of rage, it usually didn't stop for a few days and everyone walked on eggshells the rest of the night and the rest of the weekend. 

It seems like such a small incident, there were many more incidents with my father that were so much worse. I've known for years (+ in therapy) that my childhood was not ""normal"" and that tiptoeing around everything is a direct consequence of that. But I always focused on the bigger incidents. 

But it hit me that night that that incident is the reason why I don't eat anything that I don't pay for. I always go dutch at outings or cover the entire tab (only exception is my husband, and even then I paid for almost everything when we dated, he's not a gold digger, so let's not go down that route). 

How the fuck did I go 20 fucking years without realising this. I hate my fucking brain sometimes.

Thanks for letting me get it out",To add if you can learn to treat food as fuel for your body and keep yourself from going down the road of migraines I highly recommend it. Migraines are no joke and they hit me like a truck at 35. I wish I would have learned better habits earlier.,concur

"Most of the time I would like to believe that I’m moderately intelligent, experienced (in my industry), and socially competent enough to be a competitive hire for most of the jobs I apply for. I have a Bachelors’ degree from a decent college, where I was involved on campus and held leadership positions in different organizations. Years later, I’m currently working 3rd shift stocking shelves in retail to earn money, struggling to close out on jobs that I actually want. For the last couple of years, this has been a trend for me. I’ll get interviews, feel I perform decent enough or at least connect with the person interviewing me and will get that same rejection email. I’ll admit, the more I get rejected for these roles - the bigger the chip on my shoulder gets. I think maybe I’ve started to get nervous during interviews where I used to not, because it feels like each one, the rest of my life rides on nailing it. I have lost any self-esteem I’ve had to where I either don’t want to apply for jobs or bother with interviews, because it’s like setting myself up to get rejected. I know I’ll never get anywhere if I give up, but I’ve started to develop the mindset that maybe I’m just not meant for the professional life I desire. The world needs ditch diggers and maybe that’s all I’ll ever be. And when I’m really down on myself, sometimes I feel maybe I’m not even meant for this world without a role that makes me feel fulfilled in any way.

"Exactly what the title says. But more detail-

Let’s say things ended with someone- doesn’t even matter who ended it. And in that breakup discussion you were nicer to them than they deserved. Instead of telling them the ways they hurt you, you made it sound mutual and kind and blameless. But later, you thought about all the hurtful things they did that you let slide for whatever reason (avoiding conflict probably?) that you never brought up and they may not even realize they did.

Did going back after a breakup and telling someone how they did something wrong that hurt you make you feel better? Did it make you feel worse? Or, do you regret not having done it? ","It depends on how you define ""telling off an ex."" My ex-wife left me in January 2018 (after a *very* difficult 12 years of marriage), and I was depressed, numb, and honestly kinda pathetic for a while. I tried *all I could* to get her back. After about a year (and some much-needed counseling), I got to where I was finally ready to start dating seriously again, and I managed to hit it off with this really sweet, wonderful woman who was *also* recovering from a bad marriage. However, my ex-wife (who had been dating some other guy for *several* months) tearfully and unexpectedly told me she wanted us to try again. At first I scoffed at the idea, especially since I was finally happy with someone else. But after a week or two of agonizing over it, I eventually decided that I couldn't look our kids in the face if I didn't at least *try* to keep our family together. So I told the woman I was dating *everything*. Shockingly, she was very understanding and supportive, and I soon moved back in with my ex. Long story short, it *still* didn't work out. Nothing changed. We spent almost two years living like roommates and co-parents, she never made an effort to move forward, and I finally left for good. So again, I moved on. Then in January 2022, I met someone new that I *really* liked and we started developing a relationship. And once again, my ex-wife swooped in and claimed that she'd seen the error of her ways, that she'd changed, and that she wanted us to try again *again*. But I was *done*. I'd been through this once, and I wasn't about to go through this whole mess *again*. I found someone new, and I wasn't going to just let that go like I had before. So I wrote my ex-wife a very long, detailed email explaining why I was not going to ""try again"" with her this time. I wasn't mean or cruel. I didn't set out to hurt her feelings or to get revenge or whatever. But I was very open and honest, and after going through a lengthy timeline of all my attempts over the years to swallow my pride and keep our marriage together, I listed all of the reasons why I'd chosen to move out (and move *on*) for good in the first place: All of the thoughtless and hurtful crap that I was simply tired of dealing with because it made me feel insecure, unloved, unappreciated, and like I would never be enough for her. Did it make me feel better? *Absolutely*. But not because I wanted to get back at her or something. I don't hate her, and I wasn't even angry anymore about all the crap in our past (including years of infidelity on her part). No, writing that email made me feel better because I was finally saying everything I wanted/needed to say. I was finally advocating for myself and standing up for my own mental and emotional health. I was refusing to allow my misplaced sense of obligation to get in the way of my happiness. *I was taking my life into my own hands.* I still have a copy of that email saved and I look at it from time to time.",concur
"I had a teratoma tumor (Stage 1B) with a neoplasia in situ (stage 0) and had surgery 5 weeks ago and feel great honestly, pre-surgery I thought I was dying and after surgery I have improved in every way so when I got the final diagnosis it felt like, okay this is finally done with and can move on, but then they did blood tests and the numbers are way off and now, suddenly they are raising serious concerns and now ports, PET scan and 3 month of aggressive chemo by the tumor board is pushing for immediate action even though, I'd like to see more blood tests given the time frame.

The tumor also produced large amounts of estrogen which caused significant body changes contributing to pain as well.

* **Left testis, radical orchiectomy:**
* **Organ-confined post-pubertal type teratoma:** The tumor is a teratoma (a type of germ cell tumor) that is confined within the testis and has not spread beyond it. ""Post-pubertal type"" refers to a form of teratoma that occurs after puberty, which behaves differently from pre-pubertal teratomas.
* **Spermatic cord margin negative for tumor:**
* **Pathologic stage pT1b pNX (AJCC 8th edition):**
   * **pT1b:** The tumor is limited to the testis but has certain features such as size or involvement that place it in this specific category.
   * **pNX:** Lymph nodes were not assessed or cannot be assessed (meaning they don't have conclusive data on lymph node involvement from this specimen).
* **No yolk sac tumor identified despite elevated AFP:** Although your blood tests showed elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker often elevated in yolk sac tumors, none was found in the tissue examined. They checked carefully using special stains (immunohistochemistry) and didn't find clear evidence of yolk sac tumor cells.
* **Small focus of germ cell neoplasia in situ:** This means there are some abnormal germ cells present in the testis that could be the source of elevated beta-hCG levels (another tumor marker).
* **Overall: Post-pubertal type teratoma with no clear evidence of other germ cell tumor components.**

It was removed with no evidence of more aggressive tumors, with clear margins and no invasive spread detected.   CT Scan with contrast only detected the 3cm teratoma, everything else looked clear.  X-Ray of the same area revealed bone structure also clear,   CT Scan without contrast of chest also showed clear results.

Pure mature teratoma (no yolk sac, no embryonal carcinoma, no choriocarcinoma).

* Confined to testis with clear margins.
* No lymphovascular invasion reported.

Blood Test Results - Surgery to remove the tumor occurred on June 16th

Estrogen, Blood, Serum  
June 5th 390  
July 8th 340

LD  
June 5th 1087  
July 8th 1300

This is a concern, but I had surgery and a hematoma formed, which could be a reason for this?

Beta-HCG, Quantitative  
June 5th 2050  
July 8th  1750

AFP

June 5th 321.4  
July 8th 560

This is the concerning part, also the surgery was on June 16th which could further increased the AFP in the time frame,  this is likely the cause of the concern and subsequent Chemo request?

No actual checks of the lymph nodes were done because the tumor was supposedly removed with clear margins,  The surgeon also detected a hematoma in the removed testis part which could also raise certain levels.

**Bottom line, here - is there a benign reasoning for this, should I request another blood marker panel first before just jumping straight into 3 months of destructive chemo,   I can still feel firmness on the surgery site given its still healing, and can feel the small lump of the hemotoma where the surgeon located it on my two-week post op appointment.**

**I know, microscopic spread was not confirmed, the surgeon started that tumor burn-out was his professional opinion,   I have an appointment with the oncologist on Wednesday and I feel like I should directly request a retest of the Beta HCG, LD and AFP at least,  if the AFP and LD are continuing to rise, that could mean - either microscopic spread or possible hidden tumor somewhere outside of the area's that were tested?**

Reasonable assumptions, could it also mean something sneaked by and infected some lymph nodes that are swollen,   that swelling also does not automatically mean cancer, they could be reactive to the pain, surgery too.

**On top of all this, my house is problematic for chemo therapy in general, we have cats, a dog and a cockatiel,  plus we have limited space, mildew issues and other potential issues.** ","I don't know, I got a zio patch installed earlier and have to wear it for 14 days. A PET scan after that and then it becomes the moment of truth. Now, as you said - today was a revelation. My teratoma was something I was born with apparently, meaning it was a congenital and considering my brother and mother had cancer, it is highly likely it is genetic, this is what they also discussed at my tumor board and gave me an urgent message to contact all my remaining family back in the UK to seriously consider getting some blood work or tests to make sure they are clear.",concur

Just throwing myself into the work not caring much about the result. Sometimes the result is there, and sometimes it is not. But it doesn’t matter.

"Location: Florida.

I had signed a contract with a solar panel company to begin work on Monday, July 14, 2025. For various reasons, I had canceled the installation on the previous week on Thursday, July 10th. I canceled by calling the loan company and pulling the financing from the project. The vendor called and texted me the same day to voice his disappointment and anger over my decision. I ignored all calls and texts. On Friday, July 11th while I was at work, an 18-wheeler dropped off all of the materials and tools to start the work. I both texted and called the vendor and filed a complaint with the company to retrieve their materials. Every 2-4 days, a group of contractors of 4-6 men show up to pick up some of the materials, but never all of it. To this day, July 24th, the materials continue to be in the middle of my driveway impeding me from parking in it at my leisure. I have video camera evidence to support all of this. What more can I do to precipitate the removal of these materials from my property if anything at all?

"I was diagnosed last year in September and was told to wait 1 year before my next appointment that is coming up soon (hopefully) and have felt that I need medication for years. I also asked for therapy for years but only told I'm in a queue while my issues destroy my life.

I struggle with impulsivity, overwhelming feelings, anxiety and social fears, low energy and all sorts of things. I had a bad childhood and trust issues, it has been suggested but never diagnosed PTSD because of my past and that I have nightmares, defensive behaviours and emotional triggers.

Since I got my first apartment at 17 I accrued debt, struggled to survive while feeling overwhelmed and my emotions causing problems. I made many mistakes economical and wasn't strong enough to endure having a job, no guidance and no support, eventually I got my first lasting job at 27, having been isolated due to agoraphobia and failing at job activities, relationships and such.

I always been self-aware and worked with the belief that I can be better, but my fears, anxiety and depression coupled with emotional instability, made it impossible despite occasionally months of hard discipline, I end up crashing and losing self-control.

I have a lot of debts from impulsive ordering take out, shopping and collecting part-payment plans. Recently I managed to finally get a loan with low rate, gathered up majority of my expansive loans but feel I'm going downhill again, because I have below minium to afford living, most months I barely can afford food and others I can't pay my monthly costs, my income is part-time and studying.

It's hard trying to focus on studying when I get drained easily by working in retail, but even if I'm alone at home I get drained of energy and willpower.

"This is pretty fucked up, but my brother died two years ago. Shortly after his death, his dad (different dads) was able to sign into his iCloud account with the goal of finding pictures of him for his funeral and memorial posts. While I was in the depths of grief having just lost my older brother, his dad called me one afternoon pleading with me to go through his photo gallery so he and my brother’s grandmother could search his photo gallery for pictures/memories/etc.

Initially I refused (for obvious reasons). My brother’s dad told me he understood and that he would figure it out. Couple days later, I got a call from my brother’s grandmother who was crying because she couldn’t go through his pictures (mind you, all of this happened within a week of his death so emotions everywhere were through the roof).

I felt bad for her, and I felt bad for his dad and everyone else that wanted these pictures off his phone but didn’t want to potentially see any inappropriate pictures of him. I finally gave in and logged into his iCloud account and scoured his 1000+ picture gallery for anything he wouldn’t want his family seeing.

It was a lot. Both in the number of pictures and the mental strain this whole experience had on me - but I did it and his family was able to get the pictures they wanted.

I’ve always felt weird about doing that. I hate that doing that was the last thing I ever did for my brother. While I’m sure he’s happy somewhere knowing his dad and grandmother didn’t have to see that, I hate that I had to be the one that did.

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down. Anyways, I was a fighter and got to know that it has higher chances of survival so I fought and finally I won Cancer in Dec if 2018 itself. Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it. 

So, now while I have recovered and doing all well, It broke me. My mind is not as sharp as it was. I am always angry, frustrated, mean and need support for decisions. It broke me! I am not what I was earlier and may never be.

My child wasn’t in the picture at the time his father had custody. My fiancé had 2 daughters, which one lived with her mother and he payed child support. Now for the questions to start coming in. His second daughter, DNA has never been done but the mother swears the child is his. In 2021 after Covid was fading out she randomly messages him after finding out he is with me. Mind you the child is now 4. She is demanding he send money for this and that, I told him if she wanted to go through the courts we would pay for the DNA. I see it as if it’s your child you should man up and do what’s right. She declined almost instantly. She said she would just go to the courts and have him called in. Well fast forward to 2023 and we didn’t hear anything from the courts. I decided to look up online and see she is doing paternity for this child but with a man of her other 2 kids. Fast forward to 2024 still haven’t heard anything and decided to check again only to see that this child has the same last name as the man for her other 2 kids. I feel it’s important to note that this man that she brought in for paternity was there the day the child was born that she is accusing my fiancé of being the father of. Also to add he signed the birth certificate for her in the hospital. Fast forward to 2025 she has message family trying to start it all back up. So now my questions?

Should we petition court for DNA?
Is the other the father because he signed the birth certificate? 
Does it make her his child since she has his last name?

"Location:  Oregon

On 06-01 I started working in this workplace, with a 2 year contract. This type of work requires custom tools per worker, which the company pays for.

The contract says that if you willingly don't work the time, without proper reason (health reasons or other manager approved situations) you are responsible to reimburse the company. This applies if you miss 20% of your hours in a 31 day span.

And you are liable for any overtime paid to others that have to finish your job, if you don't work with the proper reason.

If you get fired, you aren't responsible for the cost of tools or overpay. And with permission can take the tools with you.

On 07-02 I got in to an conflict with a coworker. The reason for the conflict had risen when he tried to give me tasks that weren't my job to handle.

He made a complaint to one of the managers (I had a direct manager, who this person wasn't), and I got fired. Reason being as this wasn't the first complaint about me, which in theory wouldn't surprise me.

On 07-10 I got a call from my direct manager asking why I wasn't in for a week. I explained the situation, and he said that the other manager doesn't have power to fire me. And that I am in breach of contract.

I have the firing in writing in my email, but the call went so fast I forget to get to it.

My direct manager said something close to ""As this is a legal issue now, all our contract must go through our legal department. Please don't come in, as that would be trespassing.""

I (23F) come from a very large and dysfunctional family, I have 4 siblings and we share the same mother, myself the only one with a different father, and all of my siblings are 10+ years older than I am, so by the time I was old enough to form memories most of them were already in high school or moving out of the house. Growing up I’ve always felt somewhat of a black sheep or an outcast, whether that was because of the age differences, or that I didn’t share a father, or maybe purely because they were sick of my mom having more kids. They never really acknowledged me unless they had to, didn’t really hang out with me, shooed me away every chance they had, even lowkey tortured me as a toddler by locking me in closets and other crazy shit like that so they wouldn’t have to babysit me, etc. 

I was a fairly perceptive kid, I was constantly trying to earn approval somehow, but as I got older I realized that they really didn’t have any interest in being my siblings, and it was more like I was just the mutt my mom decided to keep. Once, when I was 13, my mom admitted to me that when my siblings found out she was pregnant, they immediately told her to get an abortion. I stopped trying so hard, tired of hurting my own feelings from their rejection, and by the time I was in high school I had barely any line of communication with most of my siblings. 

The only one I can give any credit to was my sister Martha (34F), who was the youngest before I was. She was 11 when I was born, and I was her little buddy for the most part until she moved away for college, and even after she moved back to our hometown, she kept an open line of communication with me, in case I ever needed another adult. She took me in at 16 so I could finish high school, after suffering from one of the worst blow out fights of the decade with my mom, deeming it unsafe for me to return home, and we grew closer than ever as I got older.

She was the only sibling who reached out when my dad died earlier this year, and even helped cover some of his funeral costs, plus paid some of my bills when I was going under from all the stress. I owe a lot to her, and I remind her all the time how much I appreciated her stepping up for me when no one else would, despite having significantly less money and time to devote to me than the rest of our siblings, she did everything she could. 

My birthday is coming up in a week, my sister Katherine’s (45F) birthday is 3 days before mine, so Martha recently reminded me to not forget to tell Katherine happy birthday this year. I kinda raised an eyebrow at her, because I never told her I forgot the year before, meaning Katherine must’ve said something to her about it. I told her straight up that Katherine has forgotten my birthday for the past 5 years, so I don’t see why she’d care if she hears from me or not, considering we’re not even really family anyway. The last bit seemed to rub Martha wrong, and she immediately asked what I meant by that. 

I laid it out plainly and told her that Katherine is honestly a stranger to me, we haven’t had an actual conversation in over 6 years, and she refuses to reach out to me first despite being a grown woman, she always has to say something to Martha to relay to me; I wouldn’t really consider that familial communication. Same goes for the rest of them, we haven’t had an actual interaction face to face or even over the phone in just as long, and they’re just as uninvolved in my life as I am theirs, using Martha as a messenger instead of talking to me themselves. Martha tried to wave it off, saying that regardless we’re still related, we’re all still a family, and I can be the bigger person and rise above our siblings’ immature behavior since I have a good head on my shoulders. I flat out told her that no, we aren’t a family, we were never raised to be that way, we’re just a group of people who happened to come out of the same woman. I said that I may be a part of Martha’s family, but I’m not apart of OUR family that we share, and it’s always been made apparent to me.

The convo continued with Martha telling me that I won’t get what I don’t give, and I said the same goes for them, they’re all adults with their own lives and so am I, yet they all make the time to talk to each other, excluding me. I’ve essentially lived my entire life with them not caring about my existence and that it really doesn’t make a difference to me whether they ever reach out to me or not. I didn’t want to continue arguing with her, because I knew that we were just going to have to agree to disagree, so I told her I’ll consider them family when they decide they finally wanna do the same for me and show they genuinely care, not just because they feel I owe them my time solely because they’re older and I’m younger. Since then, Martha hasn’t brought up Katherine, but her husband did tell me that she told Katherine about what I said and now she’s crying to our other siblings wondering “where they went wrong enough to be shunned by OP for no reason.”

I wanna make it clear that they’re not “shunned”, they follow my social medias, they have my phone number, my mailing address, they can reach out anytime if they want to hear from me so badly or feel entitled to my time, but they don’t, and I frankly have enough going on right now that speaking to any of them is the last thing on my mind. I know Martha probably feels hurt and somewhat lumped in with the rest of them from my statement, and I want to apologize to her, but I also want to make it clear to her and our other siblings that I’m not playing telephone with them anymore. I need to make it apparent that I’m noting shunning them, but I frankly owe them nothing.

Any advice for how I can go about this without making it seem like I’m trying to cut them all off? And not like I’m rolling over for them? I’ll take what I can get, thanks. 
","Ah yes, the magical one-way telephone. I know it well 🙄 Your stance is entirely reasonable - why the fuck *should* you put effort into a “relationship” when they won’t? Unfortunately, at the end of the day, you can’t communicate what people aren’t willing to hear, and your oldest siblings are way too enmeshed in their own whatever it is (victimhood, re-written narrative about how they treated you growing up, blah blah blah take your pick) to be willing to take this on board. Carry on as you were with them. Leave the door open - hey, here’s my number and my email, feel free to stay in touch - but I’d leave it at that. They don’t sound like they deserve any more time and energy. As for Martha, I’d keep it pretty simple. Point out to her that you’re really sorry if you made it seem like she’s lumped in with the others, because she’s not - you have a reciprocal relationship that’s entirely different, and has nothing to do with them. I’d also think about setting some gentle boundaries with her in terms of communication with/about the others. In short, keep doing what you’re doing. I’m genuinely impressed with the maturity of your response to this ridiculous situation - it took me yeeeears to get to that level of detachment.",concur

"Not about OLD for once ;), but about flirting out there — in the wild.

"I had my dog (golden retriever) that I’ve raised since he was 12 weeks old. He is 3 years old now and my girlfriend thinks I love my dog more than her

In all honesty, I do love my dog. A LOT. I’ve raised him and means everything to me, he’s family. 

I met my girlfriend last year, we moved in together after 6 months and she is upset and jealous of my closeness with him. 

She keeps on asking me if I could only choose to save one, my dog or her in a fire, who would it be? I mean wtf..  I’ve been avoiding answering her to hurt her feelings, as it’s a hypothetical question - I would choose both if I could.. 

I feel that every time she asks this, she expects me to give an answer saying I’ll choose her and let my dog burn in the fire, I would rather see myself burn to death before I would give up on my dog. 

She is quite persistent along this question and has a dislike towards my dog because of this,  I’ve been getting emotionally turned off by this. 

What’s the best way to approach this without cutting off the relationship?
","Getting rid of the dog is the only solution she'll accept. The relationship isn't worth it. Love isn't possessive and jealous like this. There are so many people out there who will find your love for your dog attractive. Many women see how a man takes care of his pets as a sign of whether they will be a good father. If you want kids, do you want them grow up with a family dog? Or a mom who tells them that dad would save her before he saved them? People who act this way about pets are fundamentally bad, selfish people. If she didn't like the dog.. she didn't have to move in. She wants to be first and no one else matters.",concur

"This year has been a part of the worst period of my whole life, as stress from the Early College High School I go to and low self-esteem led me into serious depression. I have always been an all A's student, and I've always wanted to strive for something higher. Last year, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Scouting Program, and the year before that, I earned my Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. However, I never felt like it was enough, especially since it always felt like my mind would betray me at times and I would always look at the negative things I've done versus the positive things (I have ADHD). All of these accumulating bad thoughts mixed with the stress from the Early College I was talking about, mixed with loneliness and consistent rude comments by my peers led me to feel like my life was crashing down around March of this year. I would have occasional good episodes since then, but the majority of the March-July period was plagued with awful feelings and negative thoughts that I believe no human being should ever have to go through.

"I just watched something that completely changed how I think about ApoE4 and Alzheimer's risk.

For years, we've been told that carrying ApoE4 means one thing: dramatically higher Alzheimer's risk. Period. End of story.

But what if that's only half true?

Dr. Aura Ramirez just presented research that shows ApoE4 behaves COMPLETELY differently depending on your ancestry. Not just ""a little different""—we're talking about fundamental molecular changes in how the gene functions.

Here's what blew my mind:

🧬 **Discovery #1: African ancestry contains a ""genetic brake"" that naturally suppresses ApoE4 expression.** When researchers used CRISPR to remove this brake, ApoE4 expression shot up, but ONLY in African cells. European cells? No change.



🧠 **Discovery #2: In European and African brains, ApoE4 creates a dangerous imbalance:** ramping up cholesterol production while shutting down myelin (the insulation that keeps your neurons firing properly). It's like building more gas stations while letting the highways crumble.



🌎 **Discovery #3: Amerindian brain cells flip the entire script.** Their ApoE4 actually REDUCES cholesterol pathways and INCREASES myelination. Same gene, opposite effect.



**This is both fascinating science AND hope.**

Because if some populations have naturally evolved protection against ApoE4, maybe we can learn to replicate it. Maybe risk isn't as fixed as we thought. Maybe your genes aren't your destiny after all.

I've been diving deep into this research, and just posted a full breakdown on YouTube.

**If you carry ApoE4, or care about someone who does, this might be the most important 15 minutes you spend today. Remember to share it if you believe it might help someone else!**

Because the more we understand about how ancestry shapes genetic risk, the closer we get to truly personalized prevention.

What ancestry are you? Have you noticed differences in how Alzheimer's affects your family compared to others? I'd love to hear your thoughts below.","The long answer would be that it depends on you: what are your cholesterol levels, what have you tried, and a bunch of other parameters to consider like your lifestyle / environment / habits / preferences. The short answer is to do by order of priority, starting with ""no regrets moves"": 1. Lifestyle interventions (diet, exercising, fasting etc.) If LDL-C/ApoB not low enough 2. Ezetimibe (low to no side effects, other potential benefits to reduce Alz risks) Then if absolutely needed 3. Statins (make sure to take the ones that do NOT cross the BBB the hydrophilic ones like rosuvastatin, and carefully try different ones and dosage until you find one with minimal side effects) I have written a free ebook here called [the Essential Guide To Thriving with ApoE4](https://ebook.thephoenix.community) it covers the mechanism of actions of ApoE4 and explains what are the main interventions that are ""no regrets"". Everything is properly referenced, with a big priority given to human double blinded trials when they were available.

I feel truly satisfied with where I am and my life.","Good for you! Make sure you share your joy with your family, I bet it would make them happy to know how much they positively affect your life.

"My partner and I have been together for almost 8 years, and engaged for 6 1/2 yrs. We have a 2 yr old and I'm also pregnant with our *planned* second child (The planned part is very important). We've recently just moved into my parents house because we've had so many issues with the management at our apartment and we talked it out and decided we could also save a ton of money and pay off debt if we moved into my parents for a while. 

We planned on paying of debt as quickly as possible and then saving up a down-payment for a house. Good plan right? Well I have a history of recurring miscarriages and have already had complications with bleeding and cramping after moving around with this pregnancy so I've been trying to not do too much lifting or moving, which of course is terrible timing with trying to move on a time limit. Because of my limitations, I know most of the packing has been put on my partner and I've continuously have asked for my siblings and mom to go over and help my partner with packing and cleaning because I didn't want it to be all on him.

 He gets stressed out super easily and I know that could be playing a part in this situation, but when we were almost completely moved out he told me that he needed to talk to me and that I wasn't going to like what he had to say. I of course was panicking on the inside and trying not to freak out, but said okay let's talk. He told me that he talked to his therapist and has come to the realization that all his stress isn't coming from just work, but from me. That he's not sure he wants to be with me anymore and that he's tired of ""taking care of me"" and being responsible for me.

 (Gut punch) I cried, but I sat there and listened to everything he had to say about me and how he's been feeling. He said some very hurtful things and I wanted to say a lot of things but I held back because this was his time to tell me how he felt so I was trying to respect that, but it really really hurt to hear what he said. To clear some things up, I'm a stay at home mom, and I'm on disability, so I have a very small set income every month. But I do pay my own bills, phone, car insurance, gas, and some groceries where i can (so I don't fully understand how he's ""tired of taking care of me""). 

Yes, we knew I would be staying home with the kids way before we had our first kid, and we PLANNED our second kid, after 3 back to back miscarriages. So I'm heartbroken and confused where this is all coming from. Yes he's makes way more money than me, and the we majority of the bills and costs are on him, so I understand that he's stressed out, but this feels like it's coming out of nowhere right now. 

so now we're moved into my parents and he's been completely ignoring me. He won't hardly look at me or talk to me unless he needs to or I talk to him first. After the first week of ignoring me, when we were laying down he started cuddling me and we ended up having sex, but then the next day he went back to ignoring me again. I asked him if on his day off he wanted to go out and get coffee with me and spend some time together just the two of us, and he said he didn't think it was a good idea to be spending alone time with me. 

 That kind of did it for me honestly. So, he can ignore for a week, fuck me one night, and then go back to ignoring all while I'm pregnant and suffering emotionally and mentally through whatever this is. I'm scared to be a single mother, but i know i can do it if i have to. But I love my partner and have never even thought of a life without him these past 8 years. But with how he's been treating me I'm starting to resent him and don't know if I should even try anymore. I don't want to be with someone who makes me feel unloved and unappreciated. I'm heartbroken and so angry, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

*edit* The reason we haven't gotten married is because I'm on disability and would lose my medical insurance and benefits immediately if we got married. I have a lot of medical problems and can't afford to lose my medical. We have both basically acted and treated each other like we're already married though.

 I'm not trying to shit talk him because he's the best man I know and has truly cared for me and our son and has always put us first. He's just not acting like himself right now, and I don't know if it's the stress or if he is actually talking to someone else ","Not sure why you're letting him live with you and your parents. He said he doesn't want to be with you, so bless and release. See a family lawyer to get set up for child support.",concur
"Hi all 👋🏼
I’m new here, I personally do not struggle with addiction but my partner does. He is addicted to meth, both smoking and injecting. I’m interested to hear from people in recovery - what was it for you that made you want to get sober? 
2 wonderful kids, a partner who has been supportive in every way possible and family who love and care. We have everything yet we have nothing. 2 years in active addiction (that I’m aware of), 10’s of thousands of dollars down the drain and I just can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. Every promise feels empty. I am on the brink of burning out, packing my things and moving home. I love this man with my whole heart and want nothing more than to keep our family together but I can’t live like this anymore. 
What turned it around for you? 

*Please know that I am fully aware addiction is extremely complex and no two situations are the same and I am in no way judging anyone who is struggling. I am so proud of anyone who is just trying their best to get by 🫶🏼 ","Thank you. As hard as it is for me I know it’s extremely hard for him, he carries a lot of guilt about it all. I’m so glad rehab has helped you. We have tried but he doesn’t seem to want the help. I’ve tried making appointments for him and he has tried going cold turkey multiple times, which is awful and scary and he won’t get professional help for withdrawals. I will try talking to him again. Thanks for your advice 🫶🏼 best of luck in your recovery",concur
"Lately I’ve been noticing how easy it is to lose time, hours of scrolling, endless notifications, always looking outward instead of inward. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve come to deeply value what truly brings me peace. 

This summer I started doing things I never made time for before. Walking barefoot in the grass. Making watercolour art outside. Dancing with my little cousins under summer sky. If you’re feeling burnt out, overstimulated or just numb, I highly recommend this. Step outside. Let summer remind you what it means to live in your body. Not everything worthy of your attention is behind a screen. 

Choose presence over passive consumption. Replace dopamine hits with real joy. Experience what it feels like to be curious, creative, connected without a screen.

This is what I did this summer. I visited new parks. Had a phone free picnic in our own yard with homemade food. My brother and I went to the splash pad like kids again and laughed until we couldn’t breathe. I floated on my back in a pool and let the sun touch my skin. Painted with ice chalk in the morning before my brain filled with notifications. Walked to get ice cream without headphones, just soft conversation. Helped my little cousins wash their play dishes with grass, water and giggles. We ran through sprinklers barefoot. Washed the car with Papa after a thunderstorm. We planted corn and measured how it grew.

We built a fort with leftover cloth and sticks. I tried geocaching (yes it still exists) and felt the thrill of hidden treasures. We jumped in puddles after rain. Built a backyard obstacle course with ropes, chairs and chalk. Created sidewalk masterpieces. Played follow the leader until we were dizzy. Watched a baseball game, no phones. Did scavenger hunts for feathers, odd rocks, yellow things. Identified trees. Picked sun warm peaches at an orchard. Built a drive in movie setup with bedsheets. Drew chalk roads and sent toy cars on adventures.

I danced in the rain. Bird watched early in the morning with binoculars. Went to a fair. Made water silhouettes on hot pavement. Caught fireflies in jars with holes punched in the lid. Flew a kite in the golden hour. Played tag with neighbourhood kids. Roasted s’mores. Ate dinner outside by candlelight. Made collages with flowers and leaves. Rode bikes slowly through quiet streets. Found feathers, smooth stones, heart shaped clouds.

I read outside. Watched clouds move. Painted on the porch. Invited friends for a no hands ice cream sundae party. Rolled down grassy hills. Camped in the backyard. Went on a boat ride at dusk. Built and painted a bird feeder. Had a wild outdoor dance party. Built a sandcastle with my neighbour’s daughter. Tie dyed old t-shirts. Made a time capsule. Did leaf rubbings. Went on an ABC scavenger hunt (A for ant, B for bark, C for cloud). Hula hooped like fools. Made pinecone bird feeders. Went camping. Played barefoot soccer. Jumped rope. Jumped again because it made me feel like me.

Went fishing with my uncle. Planted a garden with Mama. Lit sparklers, it felt like Diwali. Let the kids run wild while we watched them. Washed bikes. Painted flowerpots. Took hammock naps. Played cornhole. Sold lemonade. Did yoga on bare earth, no mat.

We turned delivery boxes into forts, cars, houses. Watched butterflies flit. Blew bubbles. Hosted a progressive brunch with neighbours, each house served a dish. Played bocce ball. Pretended to be pirates. Observed bugs with magnifying glasses. Played hide and seek. Had a 2000s music BBQ. Played ladder ball. Made garden markers with stones. Had a literal pie throwing contest. Watched another baseball game. Took a bird counting walk with my Aaju. Had a messy water balloon fight. Went horseback riding. Drew racetracks. Built DIY mini golf. Did a puppet show. Built a giant Jenga tower. Had a watermelon seed spitting contest. Watched the sunset in silence. Played tennis. Visited the farmer’s market. Weeded the garden I planted. Took care of it. Took care of me. Made a birdbath. Watched them come.

I did all of this instead of disappearing into a screen. Because I wanted my life back. This isn’t about being perfect. I still use tech. But now, it doesn’t use me.

And if you’re feeling wired, numb, lost I promise the cure isn’t online. It’s under the sky. Go outside. Do something real. Touch the grass. Feel the dirt. Hear yourself laugh again.

"Hi, I need to make a decision on whether to keep or remove my right kidney+ureter, and the data I have so far is confusing to me (technically every result I have could be explained by inflammatory atypia, but the doctor seems to lean towards it being low-grade cancer). The doctor has recommended I think through my options, so I'm reaching out to this community to get your help (any similar examples, relevant info/research/guidance that could help me decide)

For context, I am a 60year old man who is otherwise healthy and has never had surgery or other major issues in my life. Nobody in my family history has had cancer. I do know many relatives who died after painful periods of dialysis though, hence my sensitivity in deciding whether to remove my kidney or not.

Below is the detailed chronological order of events:

1) My 2025 annual regular check-up identified the following in the ultrasound of my abdomen and chest: ""right gross hydronephrosis with hydroureter (upper) ? right PUJ obstruction"" 
It was recommended I contact a urologist about a kidney stone. I had been told about a small kidney stone in my 2024 annual check-up too but I ignored it and didn't make any lifestyle changes either (I used to not drink much water...)

2) I consulted Urologist #1, who recommended getting DTPA and CT scans. He was quite curt and didn't explain anything, and I got scared about doing a radioactive test so I decided to find another urologist to consult.

3) Meanwhile, I got a CT scan done: ""Gross right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to an enhancing lesion in the proximal ureter - HPE evaluation is suggested. A ureteric calculus at L5-S1 level is also noted. Right renal parenchymal thinning with mild reduced enhancement and delayed excretion - suggesting impaired renal function"". The kidney stone was noted as 1.3 x 0.9cm in size.

4) I also got a Creatinine test done: 1.18mg/dL

5) I consulted Urologist #2 in a separate hospital. He was more junior than the first one though so he seemed to overenthusiastically corroborate Urologist #1's findings and advocated for full right kidney+ureter removal ""just in case"".

6) At this point, I still hadn't found a urologist I felt comfortable with, so I identified Urologist #3 who is both senior and well respected. He was both better at explaining what is going on, and more conservative in approaching the problem, so I started following his advice. We scheduled Surgery #1 to remove the kidney stone, and take a biopsy. He managed to fragment the kidney stone but not entirely, and my ureter is super narrow by birth, so he wasn't able to get his telescoppe instruments up to the affected area to visualize and to biopsy. So we scheduled Surgery #2.

7) Meanwhile, I got a PET-CT scan done: ""Small area of focal high grade FDG uptake seen in circumferential mild enhancing soft tissue lesion in the proximal right ureter (at approx L3-L4 intervertebral level) over a length of 1.8cm and maximum thickness of 0.4cm, SUVmax 11.99. Perilesional prominent stranding in seen having indistinct fat planes with underlying psoas major muscle. Proximal hydroureteronephrosis noted with pelvic APD measuring - 4cm.""

8) We also got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #1: 
For sample 1: ""Smears and cell block show clusters of scattered benign urothelial cells and abundant crystalline material against a clear background. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""
For sample 2: ""Smears and cell block are predominantly hemorrhagic. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""

9) In Surgery #2, Urologist #3 managed to completely powder the kidney stone, and get a visual on the lesion and do the biopsy on the thickened right ureter. He ran an intraoperative biopsy test (Frozen section: cryostat sectioning, staining and microscopy): 
""FSA: focal urothelial hyperplasia with inflammation and atypia (? inflammatory). Final diagnosis on paraffin section.""

10) After the surgery, a second sample was submitted for more detailed biopsy. In this one, the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) done says ""The urothelial cells express CK7, while these are negative for CK20. p53 shows wild type expression."". The findings say ""Tiny tissue fragments are lined by hyperplastic urothelium. Focally the lining epithelium is polypoid and shows increased thickness of more than ten layers. The lining epithelial cells are fairly monotonous with mild nuclear enlargement. No mitotic activity is seen. The underlying edematous lamina propria contains lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The inflammatory cells extend into the overlying urothelium at places. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""
The final pathological diagnosis is listed as:
""A. Biopsy from thickened right ureter, intraoperative consultation: low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive.
B. Upper/mid right ureteric lesion: histomorphology favors a papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""

10) We got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #2: ""Hemorrhagic smears and cell block reveal few coherent and papillaroid clusters of urothelial cells showing mildly pleomorphic hyperchromatic oval to round nuclei with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The background shows few inflammatory cells comprising predominantly of neutrophils along with lymphocytes.
Final pathological diagnosis: cytological features are suggestive of low grade urothelial neoplasm, TPS Category V. A biopsy confirmation is essential.""

10) Urologist #3 interpreted these as being stage 1 transitional cell carcinoma, with the good news being the cancer cells have not penetrated any layers yet. He did recommend doing a DTPA test, and getting a second opinion on the biopsy from one of the best histopathologists around who has 40+ years experience with challenging cases.

11) DTPA result (remember that this was done only 11 days post-operation, so actual numbers may be higher post-recovery): 
""Left kidney: 86.5%, 44.2ml/min. 
Right kidney: 13.5%, 6.9ml/min. 
Total GFR: 51.1ml/min""

12) Second opinion on the biopsy samples:
""Microscopic appearance: The biopsy from the upper right ureter and mid ureter reveals benign polypoidal urothelial mucosa with an edematous stroma. On evaluation with IHC, p53 is not overexpressed and Mib-1 is extremely low & CK20 is negative.
Impression: Biopsy of a thickened right ureter and upper/mid right ureteric lesion: benign polypoidal inflamed urothelial mucosa with inflammatory atypia in the nuclei.""

13) Urologist #3 was completely dismissive of the second opinion for the biopsy. He stated that based on the first biopsy report, urine cytology results from Surgery #2, the visual he had when performing surgery, and the PET-CT report, he is convicted it is cancer and not atypia, and he recommends removing the kidney+ureter entirely. It is ultimately my choice though.",For doctor number 3. How is he convinced it is cancer? Is there something he can do for sure or maybe go to an oncologist. I think you need a for sure answer on if this is cancer or not.,concur

I will say a lot of the reasons she hadn’t left sooner is because the original boss of her job (who sadly passed 10 years ago, he was a great man!) sponsored both her and my dad’s green card so she’s felt she owes a lot to this company, and even though i’ve been telling her to quit for years now i’m worried that she wants to quit now.

"TLDR: Rant about how distressing it is to go from healthy to bedbound/disabled in 1 month with no clear solution or timeline to healing.



On June 4 I got 1 night of stuffy nose, high fever, and chills followed by an extremely painful sore throat for 4 days. I thought it was the flu, or just a cold, I didn't even consider COVID nor test for anything. When those symptoms stopped, I slept 12+ hours a day but just chalked it up to being my usual laziness/depression. So I decided to go on a hike to ""kickstart my body with exercise!"" (what an absolutely ableist idea!!), during which the brain fog was so severe and I was so breathless, but I pushed through. 2 days later I crashed so hard, experienced 2 bouts of horrifying tachycardia (I thought I was dying). I also noticed I had histamine intolerance symptoms after eating soy. I started on a Long COVID research rabbit hole and convinced myself I had CFS because the crash seemed like PEM. This was the start of being housebound.

  
Then I underwent multiple major stressors which made the fatigue and insomnia worse, to the point I could not get out of bed unassisted. For the insomnia and panic, I was prescribed multiple different benzos, which I used for 3-4 weeks, but now I think I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I've bought all sorts of supplements which I've found through this Reddit and the TREATME study, I use them with the fear I'll react negatively, or it'll make me worse. I went to the ER and from the tests they ran, there's nothing wrong with me that stands out.

My body is so heavy, even when lying down. My sinuses seem to be permanently inflamed. At least my brain works, but it's difficult to focus for long periods of time. My heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure have lost all rhyme or reason. My brain doesn't shut down to sleep, and when I wake up it's always from some twisted dream. I feel like I'm no longer a human being but just an experiment. Trying acupuncture, trying Chinese medicinal herbs, trying this or that. I pin my hopes on (another) Stellate Ganglion Block, or that right now it's mostly benzo withdrawal and it will ease in 6 weeks. I ruminate too much, which makes me suffer more.

  
My mind is just filled with medical anxiety, fear that this is the start of chronic illness, fear that my body is permanently ruined. That no medicine nor doctor can help me. I've already lost 10% of my body weight which is entirely basic function muscle. (I was only 52kg/114 pounds to begin with)

  
I try to see the positives. I'm not so lifeless that I can't get out of bed anymore. I live somewhere with a perfect climate and next to nature so I can lay outside and watch the birds and butterflies. I haven't experienced a crash from my new, slightly improved activity levels, so no CFS (yet) haha!!

  
The only thing that is 80% guaranteed to heal me is time, but the time does not easily pass when I have no long-lasting reasons to be happy, when I'm hot most of the time, uncomfortable 98% of the time, when I can't even nap to escape the situation. Even simple online games I loved playing don't feel satisfying anymore. Staying sane is an active effort.

I can't imagine the strength of everyone here who's been fighting with this for months, years. I don't even qualify for the 3+ month definition for Long COVID yet. I hope I recover so I don't have to. And if I don't, I hope to become strong.","Pacing is your best ally for now. You can try to research about Nicotine patches -carefully and with pacing-.

"Hi everyone,

I’m a rising third-year PhD student at a \~top US university, focusing on causal inference with machine learning. As I navigate the intense “publish or perish” culture, I’m gradually realizing that academia isn’t the right fit for me. Now that I’m exploring industry opportunities, I’ve noticed that most of the well-paid ML roles in tech target vision or language researchers. This is understandable, since causal ML doesn’t seem to be in as much demand.

So far, I have one paper accepted at ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR, and I expect to publish another one or two in those venues over the next few years. While I know causal inference certainly provides a strong foundation for a data scientist role (which I could have landed straight out of a master’s), I’d really like a position that fully leverages my PhD training in research such as research scientist or applied scientist roles at FAANG.

What do you think are the most (1) well-compensated and (2) specialized industry roles for causal ML researchers?

**Clarification:** There are two main flavors of “causal ML” research. One applies machine learning techniques to causal inference problems, and the other incorporates causal structure into core ML methods. My work falls into the first category, which leans more toward statistics and econometrics, whereas the latter is more traditional CS/ML-focused.

Thanks in advance for any insights!","You can get really good salaries as a Data Scientist working in AB Testing, Behavioral Economics and causal inference in general. Tech companies AB test every feature they implement, so you're in luck ;) Like you said though, LLMs are in high demand and causal inference isn't super hot right now. The biggest tech companies are also offshoring jobs (Google is setting up new HQs in Mexico for example) because DS roles have become incredibly expensive in the US. I think Big Tech is your best shot. Finance is good too, but testing isn't taken so seriously and a lot of experiments are illegal (because it can be interpreted as price/interest rate discrimination).

"So, I work from home.  My med change has been making things hard lately, and impacting my performance.   
I preemptively sent my boss an email saying that I had noticed my output had decreased, and I was leaving a lot of things half finished and incomplete without realizing it. I then asked for possible accommodations, listing a few options. The one that I stated I wanted and personally find the most helpful are short daily check ins. 



In the past, when I asked for this, he had stated that I shouldn't need a babysitter-- that needing someone to monitor me is unsuitable.  I don't want to be monitored, I want visible accountability at the end of the day to help trick my brain into getting everything done.  I don't know why it works, but it helps me an incredible amount.  



Today, he tried to have me break down **why** I thought it would do any good.  He really spent a lot of time trying to talk me out of wanting that one, and offered adjusting my schedule instead.  I had included schedule change on the list since before he had recommended that, even though I do my best work in the early morning, and I very much don't want that. I don't know how it would fix anything, but he really wants me to take a later shift. I would be the only one working that late, which seems like the literal opposite of what I need. 

  
After I explained that currently, I would like the check in for a kind of reality check, because I can't trust my judgement, he asked how long I would want, and I said I didn't know, maybe two months if everything went slowly with the meds. He stated this would be an unreasonably long time and burden on someone. 

Is it really such an unreasonable request?  Is there anything else I can do by myself? A strong, consistent check in with repercussions of accountability I don't know how to do alone. 

My other coworkers all have adhd or are busy, and don't really want to be accountabillibudies.

"This is a throwaway. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for over 5 years. She has had multiple previous partners. I have a severe case of retroactive jealousy, even though she's the best possible girlfriend I could ask for.

She was my first and only, which is the main cause of my retroactive jealousy. This is not an excuse, I realize it's my flaw and I don't deny it.

Recently, I snooped through her phone (I'm a terrible person, I know) and went through her messages with her ex. 

I found several explicit videos, all of which clearly showed her face. She was only with this partner for a year or two, and over 5 years with me but she always had a strict no recording rule (which is completely fine with me).

On multiple occasions, she made it clear that we would never record each other doing the deed, and that she has never recorded it in the past with anyone else. This was obviously a lie, and I'm heart broken.

I threw up multiple times and don't know what to do. I love her so much but I honestly can't live like this. It's my fault I looked through her phone, and I don't blame her for having past partners. The thing that hurts the most is that she lied straight to my face. Her ex likely still has the videos. 

I want to own up to it and speak to her but I'm a coward. What do I do?","I think you should collect yourself first.

"Location: Florida

Yesterday, I met someone to give them a dog I've been trying to rehome. Things went well, and she seemed to like the dog and decided to move forward. She had a friend there that was a bit sketchy. All the info she had of me was an email, and my middle name. We emailed afterwards answering a couple questions: when's his birthday, how much to feed him, etc. Fast forward to today, I checked my email and there was nothing so I assumed she was doing good with the dog. I laid down to take a nap(we have a newborn), and was woken up by my wife saying two women were beating on our door. I was a bit disoriented(you know when you get woken up abruptly), and checked the nest. It was her. I was confused, we met at another location, and she had no info about me. I didn't answer, she told the nest camera she wanted to give the dog back. Then they left.

In the span of about 15 min, they leave messages on both mine and my wife's phones(numbers I didn't give them), and show up my work demanding I take the dog back(I'm on vacation). At this point I'm still confused and a little angry lol. I'm pretty non confrontational and at the same time my brother showed up.

I have 1y.o. as a research assistant + 2y.o. as an ml / computer vision engineer at a med tech company in Germany. 

I feel like I always had passion for science and natural talent in maths, but because of some life circumstances I hadn't had a chance to fulfill this dream of solving a very complicated problem or being in a challenging environment with like-minded people. That's why I'm aiming for a top tier universities like ETH or TUM, but I'm a bin unsure what topic to pick for my application.

In my current role I'm doing lots of R&D work for the company and I've identified a real unsolved industry problem that is very clearly postulated, and I think my company could even provide a large dataset for it. At the same time the problem is very domain specific and it's basically an instance segmentation problem with some extra steps, and I'm a bit afraid that it might lack the research depth needed for such top tier labs. Plus I feel like it would limit my career perspectives in the future and doing a PhD in a more general field (not domain - specific data but rather regular images/videos etc) would open more doors for me in the future.

I'm genuinely interested in the vision problems and would love to learn more about a 3d domain for example but had limited experience in it so far and not sure if I'd get accepted with this kinda topic.

"Location: Oregon 
Hi everyone! I have a legal question, but some background first: my husband and I purchased a home in the Portland Oregon area almost exactly a year ago, which has 5 mature, very beautiful, extremely tall Douglas Firs in the backyard. We were told by our neighbors that the newer houses that abut the back of our property used to all be a Douglas Fir grove, but about 5 years ago, a housing development razed all of the beautiful and historic trees (all of them, didn’t leave a single one standing) to build the houses.

One of the Firs looks a bit sad to me so we had an experienced arborist come assess. They said that it is in decline and we will need to pay to have it removed (the other 4 are doing fine for now). Because there is no longer any safe space to fell the tree, the quote is $16,000 for this work. The arborist said this tree has been slowly dying because the housing development chopped the rest of the grove that was once next to it (on the other side of our property) and destroyed a large part the tree’s root system.

So now to my legal question: can the housing development or HOA be at all held responsible for the death of our tree - albeit somewhat delayed after they removed the rest of the grove? $16,000 is a lot of money and we wouldn’t be out this money if they had built around the Firs (or at least some of them) as our streets houses did back in the early 00’s.","Unless you can prove that tree was directly affected by an action they took, poisoning, or something of the sort, no.

It just made me feel my feelings are being dismissed and theres just no empathy..

I’m getting a new assessment at a different clinic now because they don’t have monthly fees on top of appointment costs like my initial clinic had, so its cheaper in the long run.

Even if you live in a place where the government pays medical costs and they don't want to pay for redundant medical tests, getting a second opinion should be normal and acceptable right?

"Just wanna start this off by saying: 

I know i should break this off. I just don’t know HOW. 

So after being emotionally toyed with by my EX BF (22m), I ended up making cheating on my THEN BF (23m) and that costed me my relationship with him. 

I was very upset with myself so I decided to buy a train ticket to my hometown where my best friends live. 

In the past they both expressed their shared romantic feelings for me. Id be lying if i said i didn’t feel the same. We have been friends since highschool and they’ve gotten me through so much. I really have no idea who I would be without them. 

(This was about 5 or 6 days after me and my then bf split up) 
So when I got home and visited them we got drunk and had a threesome. It felt great to be embraced in this sort of intimacy. The next morning my friends asked me if I wanted to be their girlfriend (essentially a third) 

I didnt think much and I just said yes. I think I even said “fuck it sure”. A few days go by and they told me they would rather me not see other people and I complied.

I definitely don’t want to hurt them but I really just don’t think im mentally prepared for s relationship right now let alone a closed poly throuple. 

I have an incredibly low self esteem, i am overthinking things, losing my patience, and im constantly falling into depressive episodes. 

I know this can’t continue but they’ve really committed to this arrangement. They even bought train tickets to come see me in Brooklyn next month. 

My therapist told me that it might be more destructive to hide these feelings for an extended period of time. And i definitely agree with that sentiment. I don’t even know if Im cut out for polyamory as a whole.

 I genuinely just want to be alone for a bit and process my feelings regarding the various things ive gone through.

So with this my question is:

Do I wait until the visit is over or do I come clean in the next few days?

You can soften this with “this is genuinely about me; I appreciated your support so much, and would continue to appreciate it. I care about you both a lot, and would still love for you to visit.” From there, you have to decide if you want to be strictly platonic, or a bit grayer area in person (people have comfort needs sometimes? 🤷🏻‍♀️) I REALLY hope if they’ve been down for you, they’ll continue to be.",concur

"Hey all, I am about 2 weeks sober now (relapse with alcohol/weed 2 weeks ago, longer sobriety with meth and opiates). 

After that relapse of drinking, I felt bad of course for resetting my date but then I started feeling good about the program. I was feeling optimistic and felt hopeful. All of a sudden, last Tuesday, depression hit me like I ran full speed into a brick wall. It was so bad I was really contemplating suicide but I was able to call my sponsor and message other friends. Prior to this I had made a psych appointment to go over medication options if needed. I was just depressed, angry, irritated and tired. I went over my history and recent events with her. She used the word bipolar but diagnosed me with a working diagnosis of unspecified mood disorder. I have ADHD as well. She gave me gabapentin and Lamotrigine. The lamotrigine really started to work immediately. I was somewhat lifted from that depressive pit and have been feeling great up until today. It's only 25mg for now until 2 weeks I switch to 50mg for 2 weeks and then follow up with her granted there's no major side effects before going to 100mg.

I guess I am just wondering about you guys' experience with co-morbidities (mental disorders) and addiction recovery. It's kind of like chicken or egg imo. Was this mood thing always there but being masked or made worse in a way by drugs/sexually acting out? Or did these behaviors bring it out/cause it? I have always struggled with depression, impulsivity (which is part of ADHD as well), feelings/periods of high energy but also anger, rage, irritability, etc. I know trauma that I have gone through in the last 5 years or so can also play a big role in mental disorders and addiction.

Got my 83 yr old mum's CT scan back and on Friday was told she had MGI.

So we were pretty happy but I came to you for advice and in a nut shell you all warned that wasn't enough.

So I went back to the older person mental health team ( UK thing) and they said ""oh no now it's Alzheimer's, sorry we just looked properly and now we think this...sorry you now don't have time to come down to support your mum when we tell her""

So I thought we left it that the lady would say they needed to do more investigating and she would tell Mum that but skirt the A word while/until we came down 

Lady came round and told mum essentially that it was nothing to be worried about.

Now she says that's it . She will come round when we get there and tell her it's Alzheimer's ( which will obv be confusing for Mum as she thinks there's nothing wrong since the last visit)

"Edit 2: Reading the responses, I feel like I'm forced to choose between love and being financially responsible.

----------

Edit: Woke up to a bunch of comments and I responded to a lot of them. How are people dating with just a couple hundred left over each month? Especially when the man is expected to pay for the majority of dates?

Also with the women I've entered into a relationship with, the majority were expecting me to own my home, not rent.

-------------

For the women of Reddit, how important is it for the man you're dating to have his own home? I've been told by my friends and family members that one of the reasons I'm not making much dating progress is because I'm a 33 year old, East Asian (Canadian Born Chinese) male who currently lives at home with his mom. It seems that for the majority of the women I date, whether first dates or in a relationship with, the moment they hear this, they instantly lose interest. Or in the case of one of my past relationships, she said I needed to move out within 3 months of going official or she'd break up with me.

It's not that I don't want to move out. Nor am I your stereotypical guy living at home in his mom's basement. I contribute around the house and pay rent. But financially speaking, it's near impossible for me to move out. I take home over $4k/month and I still don't have sufficient down payment to buy a condo unless I borrow over $100k from my mom because I can get only about a $300k mortgage loan @ \~4%. For reference, a good 1+1 bedroom condo with parking costs about $530k in my city. After paying all expenses and the mortgage, I'd have about $500 left each month. If I rented, the amount left increases slightly to about $1,000 each month. With either option, I'd become financially stressed and would have a very difficult time saving. I'm not a fan of living with roommates either, especially since I'd be confined to my room when I have the house to myself right now. I'm fairly independent and short of taking women home for a night of fun, I can pretty much do whatever I want.
","I don’t care that he own a house or an apartment, it can be a rental. But I won’t date someone who lives at home with his parents.

"My long covid experience started about 8 months ago. Prior to that I was at peak physical fitness and mental health. I did not receive the vaccines and had covid once in 2021 for about a week which didn't seem to affect me afterwards. 

I was celibate since 2016 up until November and had a short term and very emotionally stressful relationship. Long distance. We met and she stayed here for almost two weeks. I feel a lot of grief because I started feeling sick about 10 days after she was here and believe intimate contact was the cause. 

I was very stressed for a few months and lost my ability to sleep and need to take remeron and trazedone to help. Some nights I still can't sleep. Went about two months without sleeping at my previous job. Would just lay there as the time passed. 

I probably have mcas. My body can't tolerate weed or alcohol anymore. My skin became thinner and stretchy all over. My eyes are still red all the time and can get better or worse throughout the day. I'm 35 and look young for my age but this is difficult to deal with.

My pupils can be different sizes especially at night. Usually not in the morning but it happens more in dim lighting. Eye doctor gaslit me saying it is nornal. My astigmatism also got worse and had new lenses out into my glasses.

I went to the gym every day previously. It was my favorite thing to do. My heart rate was in the 50s and now it's usually 80-100. I was laid off of my last job due to having panic attacks throughout this season and it affected my performance. I honestly didn't think I'd be able to work again but found anotner similar job. 

Not knowing what happened to my body or if it will improve or get worse really affects my quality of life. God also gave me many warning signs not to get involved in that relationship. I live alone and had a very peaceful life the last 5 years. I feel anxious all the time and am not sure what to do really. 

It doesn't feel like it has gotten worse but only time will tell. I just wish I could have my old life back where I was so focused on enjoying other things. Documentaries and podcasts and music. Since this happened I've been seeing more and more stuff about long covid when I didn't before. So much grief because I wanted to stay healthy and the information would have kept me on a smart path. I didn't consider that exposing myself to someone for almost two weeks would get me sick since they didn't seem to be sick at the time. The stress and emotional abuse probably made it worse. 

I miss weed and enjoying the simple things. Not sure if my body will ever go back to normal. If you can relate please share your thoughts. Thank you. Lo","I am also dealing with LC. My first covid infection was beginning of August 2022. Then I was infected again mid August 2023, then July 2024 and I am now day 23 post new covid infection, surprise! July 2025. The first 3 infections were brought to me by family members. This last one I picked up while my BFF was visiting and we were having dinner out, outside, if you can believe that. She's fine, thankfully. She's in her 70's. Of course I worry about her and covid. I am 53 F. Now that my shitty covid timeline has been presented, on to the LC shit... I have been dealing with LC since my first covid infection. It was horrible although I was NOT hospitalized. Thankfully. I was scared shitless...I have been fighting with reactivated EBV before I got sick with covid the first round and was warned about taking any vaccines due to being in poor condition due to EBV. I was at risk with either path I walked. I tried everything not to get sick, period. I masked, heavily, everywhere. I didn't go out to movies or inside restaurants. I masked inside stores and ordered curbside any time I could manage. The strange part was that I was actually able to work, it was part time hours and I worked outside. I loved my job. I miss my job so much. Then I was blind sided with covid. Things have not been good ever since. For the most part I am stuck at home. Every once in a while I am able to leave the house. Last year I was in a 6 month continual crash. I was not able to leave the house, not driving myself, not riding with anyone else. It was awful. The depression set in so deeply. I cried a few times per week. My stress and anxiety was in the stratosphere. December 2024 before Xmas I was finally able to leave the house. I crashed after that for several weeks, but the crash wasn't as bad as the 6 months I had just endured. I suspect MCAS. I have all sorts of food intolerance. Certain odors and average air pollutants set me off. No anaphylaxis, thankfully. The rest of my symptoms are PEM with extreme fatigue, brain fog that teeters from midrange bad to worse to not so bad a few days per week. Sore throat, headaches, and now my right hip and thigh are extremely sore in the muscles and tendons. That hip joint feels like it will separate at any moment. I now walk with a cane. My hair is overshedding. This never stopped and only got worse with each new infection. I know I have other shitty and weird symptoms of LC going on. These are the main ones I've listed. I have not been able to work since my first infection and life sucks. Here's my takeaway... I am not going to give up. I have a family that loves me. I have a few friends that love me as well. I have so much anger because of what has happened to me because of this horrible POS virus. My life will never be the same. I am convinced that I will never be able to completely go back to the way things were before covid ruined my life. What this means is that I will have to create a different life for myself while I continue to research and seek treatment to help me through this illness. Now if the people that I live with would stop bringing covid home that might be able to happen for me sooner. They are not completely at fault. This virus is a sneaky bitch. And them not masking at work has not done me any favors. I'm too tired to argue with my spouse about this any further. I am so angry that I, myself, contracted covid this last round while enjoying the only outlet I had, enjoying dinner out, outside with all the fresh air, with very few people around. It is what it is. Either way I'm not going to allow this POS virus to win. We have to attempt to find any light we can during our darkness....",concur

"Me (29M) and my ex-girlfriend (28F) were in a relationship for almost 10 years right before she decided to break up with me. We had been together since the 1st year of college and had seen many ups and downs throughout our relationship. Both our families knew that we were together and we were planning on getting married in the month of May, next year (2026). 

Every relationship has its problems and issues and so did ours. The issues mainly were about me not giving her enough time, my parents being too restrictive, her doubting if I'll be able to take a stand for her after we get married and if we will get to travel to various destinations before starting a family. 

Not to dismiss her concerns but we used to talk daily for atleast 1-2 hrs on call even while I was away doing my MBA, even when I was at home before that, we used to meet daily. I had fought with my parents and convinced them that she was the one and I was going to marry her no matter what. One of the reasons I was working hard for my MBA was to provide a good life for us and to fulfill all her wishes. 

The problem started around Jan 2024, when I first heard about a male colleague of hers (Let's call him A). They both had joined the company at the same time. I am not someone who gets jealous of my ex-gf's guy friends (most of her friends are guys) but the way she expressed care about this one was what made me think. He had just got dumped out of a 8 year long relationship himself and was kind of an alcoholic. My ex started mentioning him during our conversations and how she was worried he might do something to harm himself. He used to drink every night and drive home in an inebriated state. She started talking to him during that time to see if he reaches his home safely. 

Me and my ex started getting into fights over her increasing involvement in A's life. She kept telling me that they were just friends and that I was worrying for no reason. Her phone being busy during late nights (our usual calling time) became quite commonplace. She and A would also hangout during the day, going out on lunch etc. It reached a level where I started getting suspicious and forbade her from talking with him multiple times. But each time she would get back to talking with him like it was some drug and she was an addict. I warned her one last time that if this was more than friendship she should let me know. Yet, she kept reassuring me, with all she got, that they were just friends. 

She dumped me this January (2025), saying that she wanted to explore life outside of our relationship and that this was not because she had feelings for someone else. I kept trying to win her back ever since, doing everything I can to meet her, talk to her, stay in touch with her. Meanwhile I had started a new job and had to move to another city in April. My parents had started  making plans for our wedding and wanted to get in touch with her parents. I had not told my parents about the breakup since I was confident that I would win her back eventually (we have had 2-3 so-called breakups during our 10 year relationship and I would always convince her to get back in no time). But this time it was different.

She had asked me not to contact her and we had gone 2 months without talking as she had asked for some space. I was growing worried and anxious because it was something she had never asked for before. Later, she told me to move on and that there was no chance of us getting back together. I eventually gave up and told her that I was going to tell my parents to stop all the wedding plans. I called her to meet up one last time. 

She came to see me in the city where I was located for my job. Her attitude had drastically changed. She was all willing to get back together and everything. It was almost like everything was back to normal. I got further suspicious and decided to check her phone as her actions and words did not align at all. I had never done this before so even I was anxious to do it. 

I checked her phone. All my worst nightmares had come true. My ex and A were seeing each other and it had just started after our breakup. There were all kinds of dirty texts and View Once photos followed by  hearts and kissing and thirsty emojis. I checked her gallery and found that she had been to 5-6 tourist spots with him. It had shirtless videos of him in hotel rooms, where they had stayed together, among other things. 

My heart sank. I wanted to drop dead then and there. I was crying my eyes out. I just couldn't believe that it had happened. I confronted my ex about how she always insisted that A was just a friend and that there was nothing going on between them. She said there's still nothing going on and that there wouldn't ever be anything between them.

I told her that I knew what was going on, and sent her all the evidence that I had found. 

It has been a week now. She has been bombarding my chat with innumerable texts asking for my forgiveness and for a chance to get back together. She calls for hours and cries over the phone, apologizing and begging for me to get back together. To make matters worse, she said that she did what she did because she had feelings for him which was one of the reasons for our breakup. I told her that she should get together with him then. But she keeps on insisting and saying how I'm perfect for her and that she wants noone else, ever. She has stuck around this whole week saying that she wants to work things out with me, no matter what.

I have started feeling bad for what I'm putting her through. I truly believe that, right now, both options (getting back with her and moving on) seem equally bad for me. I am considering if I should get back with her. I know it sounds foolish but ending things with someone after 10 years is truly very difficult and complicated. Both our families are involved and whatever I decide is going to change both of our lives. Would appreciate any advice from you guys. Hope that you keep it civil. 

TL;DR - My ex-girlfriend with whom I was together for 10 years, developed feelings for her male colleague before our breakup and then started seeing him right after she dumped me. She kept lying to me all this time about them being just friends. I confronted my ex after I found out about their affair by checking her phone. She's been begging for my forgiveness ever since and it seems like she genuinely wants to get back together. I need your advice to make this decision of whether or not to take her back.

"Location: Sangamon County, IL

Im disabled and new neighbors moved in next door. They dont work, from 6am to 11pm they sit on their porch yelling on their phone and smoke newports. For the last 2 weeks every other day or if i leave the house, they stop me, asking for money, soda or cigarettes, never food.

I've declined and explained my financial situation as im barely scraping by. After the 3rd time I asked them to stop asking... after that they waited until I left the house and went to ask my boyfriend for money (like we don't communicate....).


If i call the police it'll just cause more drama and won't stop it. I don't want to even check the mail now because I get anxiety as it is and am afraid of the confrontation. When I mentioned i was disabled they quickly asked when my deposit comes in and for detailed info which of course I said mind your own business.

Permanently disabled since 2019
2 back surgeries with titanium inserted
Cannot walk without a cane and medication 
I receive disability and food stamps which allows me to buy the minimum needed to survive.

"Hey all,
Just looking for some advice or encouragement. I’m feeling the pressure big time right now.

I’m currently between jobs (starting a new one soon that pays $70K), but right now things are tight. All of my credit cards are nearly maxed out:
	•	$5,757 / $6,000
	•	$1,950 / $2,000
	•	$12,400 / $12,500
	•	$2,200 / $2,500

That’s $22,307 out of $23,000 in available credit — basically 97% utilization. I also have a car payment on top of that, and until the new job’s paycheck kicks in, things feel really overwhelming.

I’ve been making minimum payments just to stay afloat, but I know this isn’t sustainable. I’m open to any advice on how to dig myself out of this hole:
	•	Should I look into a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer card?
	•	Snowball vs avalanche method — any real-world tips?
	•	Is it worth talking to a credit counselor at this point?

I’m not looking to give up — just need a solid plan. If anyone’s been here and come out the other side, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

Thanks for reading.
","You might want to pay them off ASAP. For a back of the envelope calculation, take your monthly payment for each card pand multiply it by 90%. That's about how much you pay in interest. It could be 90% or even as low as 60%. I'm guessing you are paying like $600 per month? If so, that's $500 in interest?",concur
"My parents have been married for 52 years. We are currently about 5 years into her diagnosis. My dad has been her primary caregiver the entire time and she still lives with him at home. Recently, her incontinence episodes have become way more frequent and she has become much more aggressive. She received 2 warnings at her day care for assaulting the volunteers. It’s extremely sad because before her diagnosis, my mom was the sweetest woman you would ever meet. Never an unkind word or gesture towards anyone. She was my best friend. 

Well, today my dad let me know he has signed her up to be moved into a memory care home next week. He sounded sad, defeated, and completely burned out. I know the amount of stress he’s been under taking care of her, but part of me feels like we are failing her. I offered that maybe we could hire more help for him at home and his response was “I just can’t do this anymore.” If anyone has moved their parent into a memory care home/facility, I would really appreciate some words of encouragement right now.

"Two years ago I posted the following message on this subreddit due to an increase of shitty people who have not read the rules or the community guidelines: [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special\_enforcement\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special_enforcement_period/)



After a 6 month evaluation period, the determination was that these changes needed to become permanent.  



So here is how it is going to be. Any infraction can **will** incur a temp ban. This is to drive home the point that this shit isn't negotiable. Duration to be determined by the severity of the infraction, but ranging from 1 to 30 days.

A second offense of the same penalty, or getting numerous offenses across different rules will yield longer temp bans with every infraction. Users who demonstrate that their offenses are innate or deliberate, rather than accidental or incidental will get a full ban.

Particularly shitty people will get a 365 day ban out the gate. We believe people can change, but we're going to give them lots of time for it.

Overtly evil people, troll accounts, or bad faith people will be banned outright without warning or explanation.



As always, all actions can be appealed if you believe they are unfair. HOWEVER, we expect you to review what you said first, and review the rules as well. If you think we misinterpreted something, got the wrong guy, or whatever, please appeal on those grounds and we will review it. If you make a bad-faith appeal, whatever ban you have will be extended. If you come into modmail asking ""why was I banned"" for an obvious infraction you will get an extension. And please note that saying ""Other kids were doing it too mom"" is not a valid appeal. If you think other people need to have action taken on them, report their comments as well.

These mod actions are statutory, and are our SOP.  It's never personal.  We don't play favorites.  We take action on plenty of invalid items we totally agree with, and we take the exact same actions on stuff we vehemently disagree with.  

We are a small team. We can't see everything posted here. But we sure as hell see all the reports.



**Note:** Intent matters. Coming here trying to help and breaking a rule will be viewed very differently than coming here with cruel intentions even if the violation is a soft-ball.

**Note 2:** Please understand this is still reddit, an anonymous message board filled with sad, miserable, SMALL people. We **won't** be able to prevent shitty people wandering in. We **can** see them to the door as quickly as they arrive. **TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REPORTING SHITTY COMMENTS.** We are a 4 man mod team working in a 2.4 million subscriber subreddit, so we depend on the community to flag offenses for us to take action on.  If you see something bad, **REPORT IT!!**  We probably won't see it otherwise.  Also, if you see something shitty, report it and move on. Don't fight with an idiot, because they will lower you to their level, defeat you with experience, and get both of you banned in the process!",Thank you for your hard work and keeping this space up for all of us.,concur

"46M, inattentive ADHD, diagnosed at 45y old...

Late diagnosis, only found out after 3 burnouts at work (first after being promoted to manager).  
Very similar story to Brett's:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNCDwUv\_gkQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNCDwUv_gkQ)

I see many men here in their 40s hitting a similar ""wall"" and I wonder if ADHD + midlife crisis hits us even more hard compared to people without ADHD?

With ADHD, as long as I have a goal (career, hobby, relationships) - I can go after it (yepp, often hyperfixate on it) and it keeps me going for a while...

But now, it seems like I have fullfilled all the goals and... not sure how to describe it... ""lost the ability to dream""? I mean my dreams (like to live in a small house somewhere near a forest/lake, away from busy cities) are not very ""compatible"" with my family, so I don't go after them...

And goals like a new car, bigger house or more money don't motivate me anymore...

Now I value my ""holy peace"" time more than anything...  
Spending time in nature, walking/rucking a lot to allow my mind to ""wander"" and clear out...

Any other guys in the 40s feeling similar?

"LOCATION: Las Vegas, NV

I have the owner of a small IT computer company that has been escalating the last few months after a bad interaction regarding my 70-year-old father with dementia. My dad made an appointment with him to “fix” his computer, which did not need to be fixed… I called the IT guy to explain to him the situation and his services would not be needed. He requested to speak to my father on the phone to confirm cancellation and the first appointment was canceled. A few weeks later while I was at work I got a notification saying my father was attempting to change passwords on the bank accounts. This IT tech came to our house while I was at work and assisted my father with changing his bank account passwords and then try to charge him $300 for $150 job that wasn’t needed to begin with. I ended up meeting up with them at the bank because supposedly he insisted to bring my father to the bank to “be a good guy and help him out.” Mind you I have papers that document that my father is not able to make medical and financial decisions for himself due to this cognitive decline. The living trust that is in place has me listed as POA.

He ended up not taking any of the money because he was scared of any legal action taken against him. The next morning, I filed a police report for documentation purposes and was advised to write a Google review about the occurrence. I wrote the Google review and explained everything that happened, all factual and no lies were told. A few weeks later I get a cease and desist from an attorney that is known to give out cease and desist letters that are so extraordinarily wrong that his Google reviews showed that he’s lost a few cases for the exact situation I was in, which is attempting to say what I said was defamation of character and slander. I was advised to ignore the cease and desist which I did.

Roughly 2 months later, the same IT tech shows up at my door, almost crying and gets on his knees with $1000 cash in a hand, offering it to me in exchange for deleting the review. I did not take the money, but I recorded the entire interaction. I told him to leave multiple time and he would not leave.

The next day I went to the same police station and filed prior police report explaining the unwanted interaction. This man has been escalating, and I have been afraid for my safety because I’m not sure how far he will go.

Based on the information given, am I possibly able to get a temporary protection order from him and a harassment charge?  I have the police reports, pictures of the Google review and his response to my review, the interaction at my door, the cease and desist paper/ email and a call log showing that I called him to cancel the first appointment due to the fact my dad is cognitively impaired.","In your shoes, I'd drop a dime on the Nevada AG's Senior Protection folks on top of everything else.

"So my mum has been having bladder issues for a while now, suddenly needing to go but not making it in time, missing the toilet when going, peeing in the kitchen etc which was easy to deal with, it’s only liquid and didn’t smell too bad, but recently the bowel incontinence has started. Last night at 3am I heard a commotion between my mum and dad, leave my room and the smell hits me instantly. She had completely missed the toilet and the bathroom floor was covered, she had even stepped on it and it was in between her toes so I had to shower her down which was difficult itself as she was very upset and angry (probably embarrassed).

"After 3 yrs of dating and trying to find a partner, I finally met someone who's got most of the internal qualities anyone would want in partner. Kind, empathetic, mature, emotionally aware and the biggest one - calms my nervous system. 

However, he lives in another city, with no solid plan to move near me (my city has more job opportunities and he's been trying to change his job but the economy is horrible). I wasn’t initially considering him as a serious match due to the distance. Ended up meeting him 3 times when he was here, and found it hard to be attracted to him, if I'm being really specific, it was his body type (I hate pointing this one out). I was taken aback since his photos on the profile were old where he was much fit and younger? Every conversation I have over video calls makes me drawn to his personality but I vowed to myself that I will not entertain long distance due to my past ldr relationships. 

Now that I truly like being single, I value quality relationships. Even if I wait and let the attraction grow, I don't foresee it being possible over video calls. Appreciate any thoughts

TLDR: everything seems good emotionally with this guy but not sure if I should continue if the relationship will require us being long distance. 


Edit: Thank you all! Extremely grateful to get a response.","I don’t think you like him that way and that’s ok. Sounds like friend energy. Being attracted to someone is a huge part of a relationship, and expecting someone to lose weight isn’t really fair and going to set you both up for disappointment. The thing about long distance is it’s easier to deal with a lack of attraction and lots of talking. LDR are hard even in the best circumstances.",concur
"Alright so I (18F) recently met this super nice guy (22M) on hinge, and we got along super well. We went on a date to his apartment (ifywim), and both of us had long term in our dating profiles, and had discussed our want for a serious relationship.

One of the small details here is that I had hung out with my friend (18M), who is gay, and this guy had kind of gotten quiet after this. Not as flirtatious, responding later, etc. He also had mentioned he had been cheated on in his last relationship, but this was in October.

Now, after me talking to and hanging with my friend, he had gotten super quiet and not returning my energy, so I had asked him if he was doing okay. He said he ""couldn't give me what I was asking for"", and he had ghosted me for about 6 days. 

I was very distraught about this, I really liked him and I was under the impression he liked me to. There wasn't any big red flags that showed he didn't like me, and he genuinely had all the qualities I like in a man (nerdy, super sweet, funny, likes to build things, etc). After the 6 days, he texted me just saying he wanted to take things super slow.

He also explained that around his birthday, he tends to get quiet and he tends to just shut down for personal reasons, which is understandable. Don't blame him for it at all.

We talked for about another 1-1.5 weeks, and I began to have a lot going on. I tend to also tell people ""Hey, i'm not feeling to good, i'm just going to go to bed"", when I'm really riled up, and I told him this one night after a rough day and him not responding for a while.

Now, in the 1-1.5 weeks, he was normal for the first part. However, the last two/three days he began to shut down more, and he wouldn't flirt back or wouldn't fully return energy, but he didn't mention him having a super rough time. However, it was still around his birthday.

He was super nice, sending me long voice messages, all of that super fun stuff. I didn't really get any signs he wasn't into me or anything

Since my last text, he hasn't texted me back. It's been about 2.5 weeks, and i'm more conserned now. I really don't think he's the type to fully ghost someone, and I'm more concerned something happened to him. He hasn't been active anywhere (instagram, spotify, etc).

Him and I have talked about how much we hate when people ghost before, and he does just seem like the person who wouldn't ghost me, leading to my confusion and concern. 

I'm thinking of dming him on instagram, because I haven't dm'd him there, and seeing if he replys. He's also had situations of him losing his phone and having to get a new one before. He doesn't have read reciepts, so if I dm'd him on insta, i'd at least be able to see if he read it.

What do you guys think? Is this too stalkery, or am I okay in my concerns here?","Don’t dm him. He didn’t ghost you technically unless there is more to it after he said “he couldn’t give you what you are asking for”if there isn’t, then he warned you. Also there is a red flags and it’s two things. One is that he push and pulls you.The other is he got cheated on in his last relationship, which isn’t his fault, but is a red flag because his reaction to you saying you hung out with a male friend. What’s starting to form is a situationships. Which doesn’t sound like something that you want. From personal experience if you do want a long term relationship, don’t go to their apartments too soon if the “iykwim” means what I think it means. I’m not judging you at all, but that’s not a date. Don’t let any person convince you Netflix and chill is a date. It’s not. Also typically it’s rare to find someone on a dating app that actually wants a relationship that would do that, then start pulling these push and pull games. You deserve better than these push and pull games. Don’t trust this dude wants a long term relationship. A lot of people put that on their profile and it doesn’t mean they want one. It makes it seem like he’s keeping you around because you’re younger and unfortunately some people tend to find people on apps that want long term relationships and they to either form situationships with them or fwb. Since long term relationship wanting people that are younger tend to put up with the BS more. It’s not a huge age gap but when you’re younger it’s more noticeable because of where people are in their lives at those ages. Some people take advantage of that. You should set your own personal boundaries for dating, it will help weed out a lot of people that aren’t worth it. For example if I didn’t kiss someone on the first date that meant I saw potential to date that person. I also used their responses to “sorry, I don’t kiss on the first date” to determine if that person was safe around or had good mental health basics. Meaning if they freak out or try to force it then gtfo and get away from this person. Also again no judgement but be careful whose apartment you go to. Tell your friend their address and send a picture with their name. Heck even drop a location and a check in time. My friend and I did this at your age if we weren’t looking for relationships. Better safe than sorry. Also ask for STI tests before doing anything. Any dude that’s worth it has no problem showing you their tests and wouldn’t get offended by you asking. If they freak out I wouldn’t trust that person. There’s a lot of people that have something and don’t know or know and don’t care they are spreading it. Finally most importantly going forward don’t date or see someone that doesn’t return the same energy. If they can’t even give the bare minimum then don’t waste your time. You don’t want to be the one always reaching out first and putting majority of the effort in. Which I know is easier said than done. I get you like him but you will like other people. Trust me you’ll look back and think geez what was I thinking wasting my time on him.",concur
"I’m traveling right now and was told by some Latino friends that doctors in many LATAM countries use more natural things to treat illnesses. 

I know LATAM is still in “the West” with modern medicine, but I was hoping maybe I could see a doctor (specifically in Colombia) that might try different things than the myriad of doctors I’ve seen at home who have basically told me there’s nothing else I can do and I’m just screwed. 

Thoughts appreciated.

"I have tried more than 70 supplements, medications, and lifestyle interventions for long covid. Yes, I previously posted about this. All of the things I've tried have only *kinda* helped a little bit. Well, I decided to try Diamox on sort of a whim (long story, but I did some research and I also found that some people in the ME/CFS community find benefit, and I remembered I had some leftover that I'd taken previously for altitude sickness). And guess what... IT WORKED. I've been taking it for about 2 weeks. I've tried NOT taking it for a day, and the problems start coming back. Here are the symptoms it has affected:

* No more air hunger. I feel like I can breathe again--finally. Before, I felt like I couldn't get enough oxygen and like something with my breathing was... well, off. Now, I still sort of feel like something with my breathing is off, but I don't have that sensation of not getting enough air anymore.
* PEM significantly improved. I went for a 1.15-mile long walk with hills on Saturday morning. This normally would set me back DAYS, and I might not even experience PEM until Monday even. Well, PEM hit me Sunday instead and ONLY lasted through part of Sunday (maybe 3-4 hours), AND I was able to do things during the PEM--I wasn't completely exhausted but could nap on and off in between laundry! Normally, I would've been fine Sunday but then the PEM might hit me Monday and last 'til Wednesday or Thursday with horrible fatigue spells and brain fog throughout those days to the point where it would have been difficult to work.
* Brain fog improved.
* Swollen head feeling improved. Before, I felt like my head was swollen or had a low-key headache all the time. My head feels much lighter on Diamox. 
* Daily fatigue improved. I have been able to work without naps, lying down much less often. 

Things it hasn't improved:

* Depression. This used to be my biggest symptom before the fatigue and PEM hit me around month 2 or 3 after having COVID. It's a tiny bit more manageable to deal with, but I've struggled to find antidepressants that truly work.
* Exercise intolerance. My guess is that this is hard due to deconditioning and that this will improve with the Diamox as well.
* Heart rate issues from sitting to standing. I still feel better lying down, and electrolytes still help my symptoms. I might have POTS, per the long COVID clinic I saw yesterday. I plan to get testing done for this, but I think it's a separate issue. I find it interesting because Diamox is a diuretic and can drain your electrolytes, so you'd think this would potentially make POTS issues worse, but I haven't noticed that (I do track heart rate as well). 

My question for the Reddit community is: Why does this work? A question my long COVID doctor that I saw yesterday had: Are we looking at the wrong things when it comes to long COVID? She was not only shocked by my case in general (due to my having had COVID twice before with no lingering symptoms and my being fully vaccinated--got every booster imaginable) but she was also shocked that Diamox might be helping and wondered if COVID perhaps triggered or reactivated some sort of other illness or if I happened to have developed some sort of secondary infection that caused cerebral edema. She said they don't see cerebral edema with long COVID. 

If anyone has any ideas, I am all ears. I originally posted my theory on this but it’s since been disproven, so I’m back to the drawing board. I really don’t think it’s IIH but it COULD be, I suppose. ",Does not increased CO2 decrease pH and increase oxygen offloading? Or am I confused,concur

"A patient in a place I trained before finishing my education requested to meet my dog while I was still there. I wasn't able to at the time but promised I'd bring her at SOME point. Some point was last week - but after I found out the looooong trail of paperwork I'd have to deal with (the process is meant for regular visits and includes submitting photos of the dog and a physical ID card for the animal, not suitable for a one time visit at ALL) I decided to just do a low stakes reverse heist and sneak in with her today. 

To be clear, it's an organisational issue, not at ALL hygiene etc, in case that's a concern, dogs ARE allowed and I'm well familiar with the rules. The only consequences would have been a scolding and being asked to leave, maybe not even that - nothing serious. 

On my way to the patient I wanted to see I spotted another one I knew liked dogs, so I stopped by his room and let him pet her also, asked him not to rat me out. Located the patient I specifically wanted to see - she pet my dog, I asked her not to snitch. On the way out, I met two more I knew and let them pet the dog also, told them not to tell anyone. 

I was spotted at this point by a super nice former colleague, who, instead of ratting me out, joined the heist and suggested some of his patients who liked dogs also, so we continued on his floor. Each of the patients promised not to tell and pet/fed my dog. 

I spent about 3-4 hours sneaking a 5kg dog in a backpack through a medical facility so some 15+ patients could pet a dog (for many of them, the first in many years). It was incredibly fun for me and felt like a child sneaking around, and a loooot of people got to fulfil their wish of petting a dog again! I was offered a red bull and some ice cream as a 'bribe' for being allowed to give my dog her treats etc. Everyone was super invested in my 'crime'.

"I’m going to start by providing context to this situation. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, and for the first year he was living independently, had drive, and had a good job. This all went downhill when he moved back in with his mother in October of last year. Originally this was going to be temporary until my lease was up in April and then we were planning on moving in together. Shortly after he moved back into his mom’s house, he ended up quitting his job and getting a seasonal job at a ski resort for the winter. I ended up asking him about moving in together again and he informed me that we would not in fact be moving in together because he wanted to live rent free and save money. Which I understand not wanting to pay rent for a while as a young person, but it definitely annoyed me a bit considering that meant I had to figure out a different living situation now that we weren’t moving in together. Anyways, fast forward to now, he’s still working seasonal, making not very much money, and still living with his mom. At this point, I’m starting to get really turned off by the lack of drive he appears to have to get any sort of plan for a more stable, better paying job. Or just any sort of plan to get into a better financial situation. He won’t move out of his mom’s house because he doesn’t want to pay for anything, he always asks me to Venmo him if he pays for our food, and he can’t stick to any of the plans he makes for figuring out a career. I feel like sometimes I’m just nitpicking, because he is slightly younger than me and his brain is less developed. He also is in a situation where no one is pushing him to be responsible but me. Our family dynamics are completely different, I’m expected to be 100% self sufficient including paying for my own health and car insurance and phone bill. His only responsibility is paying for his car. So I guess it’s just really hard for me to wrap my head around being almost 23 years old and not having any plan to establish stability. I’m not sure if this is something that will change as he gets a little older or if he’ll just always be this way? And I can’t help but feel frustrated because he wasn’t this way the first year of us being together, it all just changed after he moved back in with his mom. I’m not sure if I should keep waiting it out or if I should just end things.

I am really, really enjoying my life now but I know that ""the good times will end"" and the essential me will be no more. I plan on stepping away from life towards the end of my life. It helps, I think, that I've always been an atheist and I believe I am not afraid of death.

I'd like to find any group of people who are interested in this action at the end of their useful life. Morbid? You bet! But I think this might be the best outcome for me. I intend to party-hearty as long as I and then to call it quits before the bottom falls out of my life. At this point I believe I still have years of good life left. 

Any thoughts at all on this?","Are you in the US? If so, it's incredibly complex to accomplish leaving at your chosen time, unless you do so alone, without outside help of any kind. If you are thinking about going out of the country (to Dignitas for example) that is quite costly and requires specific and thorough documentation that you have never had any sort of mental health issue, including situational depression. Anyway, on to the important bit. Quite honestly, it's YOUR life to live and leave as you choose. Peace to you for your decision and for those who love you.",oppose
"I had to go to a work conference last week. Standard networking event with dinner and drinks at one of the nicer hotels in my city. 

I had water and a coffee, didn't drink anything else and didn't eat. People found it odd, but I always make some sort of excuse like I don't trust buffets, cross contamination etc. 

I came home and was still thinking about it. Middle of the night doom scrolling I had a sudden epiphany. I never eat at parties, events, weddings, conferences etc. Ever. It just always feels wrong, like I have to prove that I didn't just show up for the free food. 

Everytime I go to someone's house or any gathering, I always take snacks, drinks, smokes, desserts, or anything they'll enjoy/use. My husband was part of my friend group, and they also noticed that I always brought something whenever I hung out with them. 

Then it hit me why I do this. It was honestly a mindfuck moment. I'm in my 30s and I'm only realising it now, how the fuck. When I was a kid, around 10 years old, I went to a wedding with my family. My parents were close to the bride's parents. My parents and their friends grew up poor, and most of them crawled out of that situation with a lot of effort. 

The food at the wedding was buffet style, and in my country the usual custom is that the caterer will charge per plate that is used. My parents knew this and decided that my entire family (6 people) will only use 2 plates since they knew their friends were struggling with the wedding costs (not eating at all would be considered insulting to the hosts).

I was sent to the buffet with my mother to get the two plates. I was told to get this curry type thing, and it was put on my plate without a bowl, so obviously the thin-ish gravy ran over half the plate (remember I was a child and did not have excellent balance). My mother saw this and reprimanded me saying that now half the plate was already taken and didn't have enough room for much other food. Fine, whatever. But my dad has a temper, we got back and he got this really angry look on his face. By then I was old enough to recognise these signs of danger from his face. I just stayed quiet, put the plate on the table and sat at the farthest chair. He immediately went off about how useless, stupid, idiotic I was and how I had wasted a plate. When he had these fits of rage, it usually didn't stop for a few days and everyone walked on eggshells the rest of the night and the rest of the weekend. 

It seems like such a small incident, there were many more incidents with my father that were so much worse. I've known for years (+ in therapy) that my childhood was not ""normal"" and that tiptoeing around everything is a direct consequence of that. But I always focused on the bigger incidents. 

But it hit me that night that that incident is the reason why I don't eat anything that I don't pay for. I always go dutch at outings or cover the entire tab (only exception is my husband, and even then I paid for almost everything when we dated, he's not a gold digger, so let's not go down that route). 

How the fuck did I go 20 fucking years without realising this. I hate my fucking brain sometimes.

Thanks for letting me get it out","It’s wild how one small moment in childhood can quietly shape decades of who we are until it suddenly punches us in the gut years later. You didn’t deserve that shame, and the fact that you’re uncovering it now means healing is finally catching up.",concur
"I have struggled with stress eating almost my entire life but it was never this out of control. 

Since the past one year, I have been ordering in EVERYDAY and I have gotten used to this so much that I don't even care about money anymore and it's affecting my health a lot. I have gained a lot of weight and I don't even go to the gym now. 

Till last year I was very active and very fit (stress eating was still there) but there was a major shift in my life and I think I sort of lost it. 

I hate being this way. I know I am wasting my potential and I can do so much better but I am just so tired of myself being like this.

"I tend to have a really hard time deciding what to eat especially when it’s for multiple people. 

I am a picky eater so my palette isn’t like that wide but I do like a decent amount of things. I am currently out of town and the person I’m staying with just called and asked me what I wanted to eat for dinner and I thought hard on what to say because I typically eat the same things and she’s said multiple times she gets tired of eating chicken all the time ( one of my biggest safe foods ) so I asked my sister but she said she was fine with anything which left me to make the decision. 

I thought for a while trying to think of something but I kept coming up blank. So I just told her I’d be fine with anything that I already like ( she knows what those things are for the most part ) she seemed to have an attitude with me because of my answer and said she’d have to figure something out before hanging up. 

When I’m at home I don’t have this issue we all eat what it is we what instead of all eating the same thing. It’s different here. 

Now I’m stuck in what to do. I’d really hate for her to pick something and then it turns out to be something I don’t like.

"My boyfriend (39m) and I (37f) decided this past week to move in together, and I am very excited. His lease ends early in the new year, so we have some time to plan (I might ask if he wants to look into early termination) before he moves into my place. Eventually (sooner rather than later) we will get engaged and start looking at new places together.

The last person I lived with was my ex-husband, who I was with 15+ years. I’ve been living alone for 5, and my boyfriend’s situation is almost identical.

What discussions should we be having now to set us up for success? We are very good communicators, and he honestly does not have much to move. I foresee this working out well as he is very social and I like my alone time during the week. Division of labor will be easy, and we’ve discussed what we want finances to look like before we are married.

Open to any advice, and would love to hear the fun success stories! I am really, really excited.","Define common terms! I lived with an ex that would get so frustrated because he'd ask me ""hey, the house is messy and it's been bugging me but I'm working overtime and can't tackle it by myself. Can you clean up some today?"" And I'd spend hours sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, conditioning the butcher block counter tops, dishes and laundry, and he'd get home and be PISSED because ""the house is still messy."" Literally maybe a few weeks prior to our 3 year long relationship ended, we found through couple's counseling that when I say ""clean up"" I mean disinfect and sanitize things. When HE said, he was referring to clutter: the pile of pocket contents on the counter, books left out on the coffee table, blankets on the couch instead of folded and put away. Recently, another partner heard me say ""we need to clean out that room and make sure there's nothing that's drawing (our recently-neutered male cat) to continue marking in there."" What I meant was ""I want us to right now go and pull sheets off the bed, gather all the laundry, sweep and mop the floor, and check if there are spots on the wall that need to be cleaned."" When he heard was ""on my next Sunday deep-clean day, lets add this task to the list."" I ended up telling him that I was frustrated to be cleaning the room by myself while he video gamed, he was apologetic that he'd misunderstood me (I reassured him this was a miscommunication on my part as well, ofc). It's little things like that, that can cause big problems! Sit down and define: when YOU say ""the trash needs to get taken out soon,"" do you mean ""right now"" or do you mean ""it's half full, once it gets to three-quarters full the next person that looks at it should take it out"" or something else? When HE says ""there's laundry in the washer"" is he letting you know so that you don't try to do laundry while he's got some already going? Or does he mean ""hey, if you hear the washer off/not running, can you switch my load into the dryer for me?"" Define terms! Make the ambiguous verybiguous! Also talk about how you'll ask each other for alone time and what that will look like for each of you. Having lived alone for so long, you both ARE likely going to have moments of overwhelm with another person constantly in the same space. Plan and discuss NOW what asking for alone time looks like. Does it mean that you say ""hey, I'm gonna go read in the bedroom for a couple hours,"" and he avoids the bedroom and doesn't text you/ send you reels or anything? When he says ""wow I'm just feeling really crowded and overwhelmed lately"" does that mean that you take the dog for a walk and engage in some quiet-time hours when you get back until he lets you know that he's feeling better? Discuss it now, so that later neither of you is trying to just power through discomfort and ending up resentful or burnt out or over stimulated! Last also: discuss house guests! He's more social, you're more introverted. What's the MAX frequency you're comfortable with having friends over, and how many, and how close do they need to be in order to be in the house? I have dated people that did not want anyone they weren't very intimate friends with visiting the home EVER because the home was their safe space. I am the type of person that is okay hosting meet-and-greet mixers for social clubs and groups. These aren't necessarily incompatible points of view, but they can require conversation and compromise! Does he envision or yearn to have a space to host dinner parties for friends that you may not have met yet? Do you require certain areas of the house (like the bedroom) to be off-limits to guests even while giving them the house tour? How do you each feel about having overnight guests?

"LLMs are inherently limited because they rely solely on textual data. The nuances of how life works, with its complex physical interactions and unspoken dynamics, simply can't be fully captured by words alone

In contrast, **V-JEPA2**, a self-supervised learning model. It learned by ""watching"" millions of hours of videos on the internet, which is enough for developing an intuitive understanding of how life works. 

In simple terms, their approach first learns extracting the predictable aspects of a video and then learns to predict what will happen next in a video at a high level.  After training, a robotic arm powered by this model imagines/predicts the consequence of its actions before choosing the best sequence of actions to execute

Overall, the model showed state-of-the-art results, but the results are not that impressive, though GPT-2 was not impressive at its time either.

"Hi Reddit, its been almost two months since my last update and I wanted to give one final update to everyone who has helped me deal with this situation. I've received a ton of good advice and well wishes and I can't thank everyone enough for the support I received in what was the loneliest time of my life.

My last update ended with my wife quitting her job, her starting individual therapy and us still being sleeping in separate rooms. 

Since then we have started couples therapy, our therapist specifically deals with emotional and physical infidelity, and go three times a week. While I know that may seem excessive to some people, we really needed. Some weeks we don't need the third session and our therapist suggested we cancel and instead go on a date, something simple where we could just get used to being around eachother again. I also started individual therapy at our couples therapist's suggestion to help me with my anger and drinking. I'm not an alcoholic but I was starting to develop a drinking problem and using it to numb myself to any pain. It's alot of fucking work but its helping. My wife and I also spoke with my eldest daughter's school as she picked up the tension in our house and it was causing behavioural issues at school and at home and they are offering support to her as well. It feels like we've had to break our family down to rebuild it again, I'm just glad my youngest is oblivious to anything going on.

After leaving her job my wife asked me if I would be okay if she didn't work for a couple months as she wanted to focus on fixing our marriage and family before she committed to something else. I get paid more than enough to cover our expenses so I agreed to it. I've never really had an opinion on her working, I would've supported her regardless of if she worked or not but seeing the way my daughters have loved having their mother home with them more and how attentive of a mother my wife is cracked me open. I just couldn't numb myself to her anymore. Instead of listening to them having fun or my daughter's laughing while being holed up in my office, I wanted to be with them. I had so much anger and pride in me that I was choosing to sulk alone and drink rather than spending time with my family that I wanted back so badly. The first time I joined them it was awkward and weird but my therapist told me I needed to sit in that discomfort and face it rather than hiding away.

My brothers and parents have been a great support during this time as well, my dad and older brothers were quicker to forgive Annie than my mom was. She adored Annie and was disappointed by what she had done but Annie has said she's going to work hard to earn everybody's trust again. Annie's mother still isn't talking to her however she still sees her granddaughters, she comes over only when Annie isn't home or I drop my daughter's off at her house sometimes so they can spend the day with her. We've gotten closer and it's weird getting invited to events from Annie's side of the family when she isn't included but I have to go for my daughters.

After multiple sessions with our couples therapist where I openly discussed how much grief her betrayal had caused me, Annie decided to tell her coworkers wife about the affair. She said she wanted to give Mark/Matt the opportunity to tell his wife himself and contacted him to say she would be letting his wife know and he should tell her before it came from somebody else. She heard from her old coworkers she was still friendly with that Mark/Matt had told his wife. Annie thought Mark/Matt's wife would've contacted her to corroborate any stories but last we heard they were separating since Annie's sister realised Mark/Matt's wife had changed her relationship status on Facebook. 

As for Annie and I, we've had to have alot of brutally honest conversations. Of course she was  not right for what she did but I also had to own upto my mistakes as well. There was so much resentment in her towards me that even she didn’t realise at first, specifically around the birth of our eldest daughter. She had felt isolated and abandoned during that pregnancy and post-partum because I was working too much and studying at the same time. She was the primary parent for the first year of our daughter's life, I thought I was doing the right thing back then and had kind of disregarded her when she said she felt overwhelmed or lonely because I felt the same way, the difference was she had a whole baby to take care of as well. She said she felt the same way after our little one was born but could handle it better since she had been through it before and didn't expect anything from me. I had to travel quite a bit for my job back then and looking back I had never really asked her if she was okay with that. It was humbling sitting there and listening to her recount the ways she had struggled while taking care of our daughters and never threw it my face. I realised that I needed her forgiveness as much as she needed mine. It's going to take time for us to rebuild this 'new relationship' but we both know the work is worth it. We're going on dates again and actually talking to eachother about something other than the kids. We're still sleeping in separate bedrooms, when it comes to physical intimacy I learnt I had a lot of issues with it when it came to my self esteem. After imagining my wife with another man I needed her to show me how much she desired me for me to feel comfortable with her again and she's been going above and beyond with that.


Apart from that I can't think of anything else to give an update on. Feel free to ask any questions I'm already a open book but the biggest lesson I've learnt from this whole situation is that complacency and miscommunication are the death of relationships. Never let your significant other feel like they aren't a priority or their needs are falling on deaf ears. It's too easy to blame one person for the demise of a relationship and in some cases that might be true but if you know a person and they do something completely out of character try to examine why. You don't have to forgive them or anything like that, sometimes it is best to walk away. Again, that's for all the support. Also, I didn't reread this so apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes.

"Over the past few weeks we have seen an uptick in posts asking about what individuals can or cannot do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or other law enforcement officers ask to enter a business or home looking for illegal immigrants. So we are making this centralized post to provide an overview of what individuals rights are in these situations. We will be locking all posts that ask questions which are covered by this post.

First, it should be stated that everyone who is physically present in the United States is protected by the fourth and fifth amendments to the United States Constitution. These rights are not dependent on citizenship or being lawfully permitted to be in the country. This means two critically important things. First, no one is required to speak with law enforcement (or any government official). Second, with some exceptions discussed below, no one can be detained or searched without probable cause. This also means that generally law enforcement cannot enter a home or space that is not open to the public without a judicial warrant (although again some exceptions are discussed below).

Another important thing to remember is that not all law enforcement officers are ICE. In fact, the vast majority of law enforcement that the average citizen will encounter are state or local officials. You should always verify claims of “ICE being in X area” and should avoid spreading rumors or speculation.

**Searches/Seizures**

This is a highly complex area of law. So there is no simple bright line rule that can be applied. However, provided law enforcement has probable cause, most searches and seizures would be permissible. Moreover, in general the remedy to an unreasonable search or seizure is that the evidence obtained is suppressed. Furthermore, it is typically criminal to interfere with or obstruct lawful actions of law enforcement. As such, while you should know and assert your rights, if law enforcement continues to states they will conduct a search or attempts to detain you as a practical matter you should assert that you object to the search or detention but should not physically interfere and should assert your rights in court. So lets dig into the details a little more.


The fourth amendment states that 
>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

Notice, the amendment does not state that a search requires a warrant. Rather it states that “the people” shall not be subject to unreasonable searches or seizures and that warrants shall only be issued upon probable cause. The Supreme Court has held that this means a warrant is preferable and is required when practicable, but that there are a host of situations in which a search or seizure would be reasonable even absent a warrant. A duly issued judicial warrant also means that a search of the place identified for the person or things identified, is presumptively reasonable.

First, in public, short detentions are permissible in instances where law enforcement can articulate a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. That reasonable suspicion must be based on specific articulable facts, not mere hunches or guesses. So for example, if a robbery occurred two blocks from where you are stopped while wearing a grey hoodie and jeans, and the suspect at the bank was described as wearing a grey hoodie and jeans, it would be reasonable to detain you to determine if you were the suspect in question. That said, even under those circumstances you would not be required to answer any questions beyond identifying yourself.

If during the course of the stop described above the officer developed probable cause to believe you were in fact the bank robber, then you could be searched and arrested for the crime. Probable cause is a fairly low standard though, it is satisfied when a reasonably prudent person, based on facts known to them at the time, would warrant the conclusion that a crime was or has been committed. 

However, under the same general set of facts just described, if you were at home at the time the officer first spoke to you, unless the officer had seen you commit the crime and followed to your house then you could not be arrested in the home. The home is considered a sacrosanct place under the fourth amendment. As such, absent observation of an ongoing crime, or where law enforcement is in hot pursuit of an individual that has been observed by the officer committing a crime, a warrant (or consent) is always required to search a private residence.

Another notable exception to these rules is that within 100 miles of the border Customs and Boarder Patrol may stop and board vehicles and vessels and search for people without immigration documentation. If the initial stop in this situation is an established checkpoint then the stop does not even require reasonable suspicion of a crime. A roving CBP patrol does require reasonable suspicion for the stop though. In either case your right to remain silent under the fifth amendment remains in place and a search of your person or personal effects would require probable cause.

When law enforcement seeks to enter a non-public place other than a home, they must have (1) probable cause based on facts they have personally observed, (2) a judicial warrant, or (3) consent of the property owner or an authorized representative. In this context, the difference between a judicial warrant and an administrative warrant is key. A judicial warrant is issued by a court (in the context of federal officials investigating immigration issues, it would be a federal court, although a state court could also issue warrants to state law enforcement). An administrative warrant is issued by an immigration officer or immigration judge. Judicial warrants may authorize entry into non-public spaces. Administrative warrants CAN NOT authorize entry into non-public areas, they simply authorize detention/arrest of an individual if that person is found in a publicly accessible space. However, as stated above, if you have stated your objection to officials entering a space because they only have an administrative warrant and they nevertheless attempt to make entry you should simply restate your objection but should not resist or obstruct them.

It is critically important that you not interfere with or obstruct any law enforcement officer carrying out a search as interference with a legal search is criminal in its own right. 18 USC Chapter 73 contains various provisions making it a crime to obstruct federal or state officials in carrying out their duties. State law will also generally make it criminal to prevent law enforcement from carrying out their duties. As such, if you have stated your objection to officials entering a space, conducting a search, or detaining anyone, you should not thereafter make efforts to impede the law enforcement officer from conducting that action.

**Right to remain silent**

The fifth amendment protects everyone in the United States, citizens and non-citizens alike, from being forced to incriminate themselves. The fifth amendment states “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.…” This means that with limited exception no one is compelled to speak with law enforcement. However, should you elect to remain silent you may be subject to additional detention/questioning. In addition, if called to testify in a civil or criminal proceeding regarding another individual, a court may reasonably determine that you do not have any reasonable ground to believe your testimony would be self-incriminating and can compel you to testify.

In addition, there are some situations outside of a judicial proceeding where you may be required to provide basic information to law enforcement. First, if the police have reasonable suspicion that you have committed a crime you may be required to identify yourself. In addition, depending on your immigration status, there are some instances where lawful residents of the United States who are not citizens are required by the terms of their admission to identify themselves and provide documentation of their legal status. This DOES NOT mean that all individuals are require to produce evidence of lawful status, it simply means that there are some programs permitting lawful presence in the United States that require individuals who are a part of those program to identify themselves.

**Right to inform others of their rights**

You may always inform others of their legal rights. The first amendment to the United States Constitution protects your legal right to tell anyone, citizen or not, that they have legal rights. This includes those who are being detained by law enforcement, although you must maintain a reasonable distance from the law enforcement officers so as to no interfere with their actions. As such, you may tell anyone, citizen or not that they do not have to speak with the police and you may tell anyone, citizen or not that they do not have to consent to a search. Such statements are not criminal even if they are addressed to individuals who are in the country unlawfully. However, you should be aware that 18 USC § 1324 does make it a crime to, among other things, intentionally conceal someone that you know (or have reckless disregard for the knowledge) is in the country illegally.

**Right to record law enforcement**

The first amendment to the United States Constitution protects your legal right, citizen or not, to record law enforcement in public spaces. You do not have to be a “member of the press” or have any relationship to the individual(s) you are recording to do so. If you are in a space you are legally permitted to be in, you cannot be legally detained simply because you are recording something which law enforcement doesn’t want on camera.","If stopped by ICE at what point is a legal US citizen legally required to identify?

"Here are the top ten most important things to learn if you think you may have symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (or early cognitive decline):

🧠 1. Know the Early Symptoms
Recognize warning signs beyond typical aging:

Memory loss affecting daily life

Trouble with planning, problem-solving, or managing finances

Difficulty with familiar tasks

Word-finding problems

Disorientation (time or place)

Mood, personality, or behavior changes

🧪 2. Understand the Diagnostic Process
Diagnosis often involves:

Cognitive testing (e.g., MoCA, MMSE)

Blood tests (to rule out B12 deficiency, thyroid problems, etc.)

Brain imaging (MRI or PET scan)

Newer tools like the PrecivityAD blood test or CSF biomarkers

Genetic testing (like APOE4) may be considered but isn’t definitive on its own

🧬 3. Learn About Risk Factors
Risk increases with:

Age (especially after 65)

APOE4 gene status

Family history

Head injuries, poor sleep, smoking, sedentary lifestyle

Cardiovascular issues (high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol)

💊 4. Know the Available Treatments
Currently approved medications:

Donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine, galantamine – help with symptoms

Memantine (Namenda) – for moderate to severe stages

Lecanemab (Leqembi) – a newer drug targeting amyloid plaques, slows progression in early stages

🧩 5. Explore Lifestyle Interventions That May Help
There’s strong evidence for:

Exercise (especially aerobic and strength training)

Mediterranean or MIND diet

Sleep hygiene

Social engagement

Cognitive stimulation

Blood sugar and blood pressure control

🧠 6. Know That Some Memory Loss Is Reversible
Check for and treat:

B12 deficiency

Thyroid disease

Depression (can mimic dementia)

Medication side effects

Sleep apnea

Alcohol overuse

Hearing loss

🧭 7. Plan Ahead: Legal, Financial, and Medical
Start early with:

Advance directives and living wills

Power of attorney (medical and financial)

Long-term care planning

Discussing care preferences with family

🗂 8. Track Symptoms and Stay Organized
Keep a daily log of symptoms (memory lapses, confusion, mood)

Bring a trusted person to doctor appointments

Use medication organizers, reminders, and calendars

Ask for a written summary after each medical visit

🧑‍⚕️ 9. Find Support and Educate Loved Ones
Local Alzheimer’s Association chapters offer education and support groups

Family members benefit from learning communication techniques (e.g., validation, not correcting)

Online communities can help ease isolation and fear

🧭 10. There Is Life After Diagnosis
Alzheimer’s is progressive, but many people live with purpose, humor, and creativity for years after diagnosis. Planning, adapting, and getting support early can extend quality of life and autonomy.

"Ranting for a minute. 

I am so bloody tired of people acting like I haven't tried to get help before this, like I've just sat back and twiddled my thumbs for years, while the world fell apart around me. 

I have tried for decades to get serious help. I have been to Area Agency on Aging. I have been to various government agencies. I have asked for cleaning help, with transportation and so on.  I have tempted and worked full and part time.  I've been active in the community.  

My parents went for clean enough to be functional their entire lives.  I've worked out a cleaning schedule and then fallen off it for whatever reasons since I first learned about Sidetracked Home Executives, way back when.

Mostly I was told not that I couldn't do anything because I didn't own the house. Or that I had to wait until they didn't care, like with Dad's Parkinsons. It never got to that stage. Or cleaning - either the above, or we can't get you help until you fix this - well, Dad refused to ""fix this"" (one of the few times I was absolutely livid with my Father). I tried, but failed. It wasn't until after he passed that I learned it wasn't a drywall problem, and that then has led on a trail of several places who have said they'd fix it, and each then ghosted us. The last guy scammed us out of $7k and basically disappeared.  I've been  stuck in a circle trying to track him down.  One place sayd check here. That place sends me back to the first place. 

Same for the other problems.  We practically had the car rebuilt last year, several things broke throughout the year. 

Could I have done better? Of course.  Hindsight is always 20/20. I've made mistakes; I'm not going to lie. I'm not perfect. But damn it, I have tried to get help for a very bloody blessed long time. Shaming me or anyone else is not frigging helpful!

Some of you seem to think I should have chucked my parents in a nursing or old age home and forgot about them. That's not who I am. I've seen that done; Mom had a rest home ministry for years. My Grandma spent years in the resg home. Again, when I checked into it, we needed to sell the 2nd house, at least five years from before when they would go into the home. Again, that has not been an option until this year. 

Of course if I could go back in time, I would. I'd make changes. But Dr. Who doesn't really exist, and that's not possible.

"Location: Ontario

Background:
* My mom immigrated to Toronto over 30 years ago and started a successful business.
* My dad married her, they ran it together, and later he took over while she stayed home to raise us.
* In 2014, her father died, and she went back home to Africa for nearly a set year to settle affairs (she's the eldest of 20 siblings). My dad encouraged her to go and gave her his full support.
* While she was away, he sold their business for $1.4 million and their home for $660k. He told her he bought a house mortgage-free in a small town in Ontario so we could live interest-free (we’re Muslim).
* She returned to find the house was much smaller and in poor condition, but let it go.
What Went Wrong:
* In 2014, they ""bought"" a new house worth $255k. He claimed it was paid in cash and both their names were on it.
* In 2019, my dad secretly married another woman abroad and had kids with her. He left our home and doesn’t live with us anymore.
* In 2022, we found out that my mom's name was removed from the title of the house in January 2021, even though she was in Edmonton from Dec 2020 to March 2021 (we have proof of her travel).
* He used an imposter to pose as my mom and sign title transfer papers, removing her from ownership. The lawyer admitted (on recording) that they accepted the ID after the meeting via WhatsApp.
* He then took out a $260k mortgage on the house (original mortgage was $130k), paid that off, paid $18k of his own credit card debt (in my mom’s name), and sent me $20k randomly to invest in a business for my aunt.
* He kept about $90k and disappeared.

How We Got Stuck:
* We found out a year later, after he stopped paying the mortgage, and the lender said they'd foreclose unless we paid it all off.
* My mom had no income or credit. So in 2023, my sister and I (both working/students) were pressured to take out a $310k private loan with high interest just to save the house.
* At the last minute, my dad refused to transfer the house fully to us unless he got 50% ownership, even though he doesn’t live here and doesn’t pay anything.
* We’ve been paying $2800/month since, while juggling jobs, school, and financial strain.
* The house has mold, leaking, and broken doors/windows. At best, it might sell for $400k as-is.
Legal Situation:
* We went to the police in 2022. They told us it was a civil matter and we needed to get a lawyer. We filed a report but haven’t heard back.
* Our lawyer at the time said we should pursue this through family law, not civil fraud, since it was ""hard to prove fraud.""
* We have evidence:
    * Fake signature vs real one
    * Travel proof showing my mom wasn’t in the province when the title was signed
    * A recorded conversation with the lawyer admitting they didn’t verify ID properly

❓My Questions:
1. Can we still go to the police and push for criminal charges (fraud, impersonation, forgery)?
2. Can we sue my dad through family court and get my mom’s share of the house back?
3. If we sell the house now, will he get 50% even though we paid everything since 2023?
4. Would it help to report the lawyer to the Law Society of Ontario for negligence?
5. What are our best legal options right now to stop bleeding money into this mess?

Any help, advice, or direction would mean the world. We're just trying to protect our mom and not go under financially.

"I went to get diagnosed at the start of this year at 22 years old. I ended up getting medicated 2 months later in April and it has been an overall amazing experience. My biggest struggle, which is college, is much more manageable and I am even excelling. I was also working full time during the spring semester, so I have always been busy. Fast forward to the end of May and I am not working because I work in a school district. I ended up finding a part time job and taking a summer class. This means I am at the house with my family much more. My mother doesn’t work so I am around her a lot. 

This is where my issue gets worse. Ever since I went for my diagnosis, my mom has been against it and questioned the validity of it. I have told her on multiple occasions all of the things that have improved, the habits I’ve kicked, explained how debilitating executive dysfunction is, and all of the other things that come with ADHD. 

Now it’s July and ever since summer has started, I hear such hurtful comments from her, but maybe she doesn’t realize what she says hurts me so much. She repeatedly says that “something is up with me”, “you’re dealing with something that you aren’t telling me”, “your whole personality changed”. These comments are all fueled by my ADHD diagnosis. If there is any change in my personality or the way I navigate my life in recent times, my mother scrutinizes me for being different. 

I want to keep this short, my mother who I have been really close with, makes me feel bad about being medicated and makes me feel like an asshole for acting differently. Honestly I can’t even think of the way I have changed, personality wise, so drastically! My girlfriend and friends seem to think I am still the same person I was before I was medicated! 

Has anyone else dealt with parents/family that have been extremely against their journey of dealing with ADHD as an adult? Thanks, I just want to get this off my chest. 

","Turns out, adhd is oftentimes genetic. And our parents internalized a lot of the stigma that has existed over many decades, both about adhd in the first place, but also for medicating it, and getting support.

I took it today and I was able to get myself organized and have some difficult conversations. It's really quite nice to be able to have this calm and centeredness underlying my day. I can actually stand up to life again.

There's so much internalized ableism I'm still unlearning that keeps me trapped in shame and guilt for how my brain operates and shames me for my reliance on medication. It is bullshit.

But I also believe very strongly the middle road is usually the best path, and an ideal life of having ADHD means balancing medication with alternative methods and taking it in rhythms and seasons. I don't know what this ideal state looks like for me, but I'm curious how others have practiced finding a balance--or what managing ADHD looks like for people similar to me.

"I had to go to a work conference last week. Standard networking event with dinner and drinks at one of the nicer hotels in my city. 

I had water and a coffee, didn't drink anything else and didn't eat. People found it odd, but I always make some sort of excuse like I don't trust buffets, cross contamination etc. 

I came home and was still thinking about it. Middle of the night doom scrolling I had a sudden epiphany. I never eat at parties, events, weddings, conferences etc. Ever. It just always feels wrong, like I have to prove that I didn't just show up for the free food. 

Everytime I go to someone's house or any gathering, I always take snacks, drinks, smokes, desserts, or anything they'll enjoy/use. My husband was part of my friend group, and they also noticed that I always brought something whenever I hung out with them. 

Then it hit me why I do this. It was honestly a mindfuck moment. I'm in my 30s and I'm only realising it now, how the fuck. When I was a kid, around 10 years old, I went to a wedding with my family. My parents were close to the bride's parents. My parents and their friends grew up poor, and most of them crawled out of that situation with a lot of effort. 

The food at the wedding was buffet style, and in my country the usual custom is that the caterer will charge per plate that is used. My parents knew this and decided that my entire family (6 people) will only use 2 plates since they knew their friends were struggling with the wedding costs (not eating at all would be considered insulting to the hosts).

I was sent to the buffet with my mother to get the two plates. I was told to get this curry type thing, and it was put on my plate without a bowl, so obviously the thin-ish gravy ran over half the plate (remember I was a child and did not have excellent balance). My mother saw this and reprimanded me saying that now half the plate was already taken and didn't have enough room for much other food. Fine, whatever. But my dad has a temper, we got back and he got this really angry look on his face. By then I was old enough to recognise these signs of danger from his face. I just stayed quiet, put the plate on the table and sat at the farthest chair. He immediately went off about how useless, stupid, idiotic I was and how I had wasted a plate. When he had these fits of rage, it usually didn't stop for a few days and everyone walked on eggshells the rest of the night and the rest of the weekend. 

It seems like such a small incident, there were many more incidents with my father that were so much worse. I've known for years (+ in therapy) that my childhood was not ""normal"" and that tiptoeing around everything is a direct consequence of that. But I always focused on the bigger incidents. 

But it hit me that night that that incident is the reason why I don't eat anything that I don't pay for. I always go dutch at outings or cover the entire tab (only exception is my husband, and even then I paid for almost everything when we dated, he's not a gold digger, so let's not go down that route). 

How the fuck did I go 20 fucking years without realising this. I hate my fucking brain sometimes.

Thanks for letting me get it out","When I was a kid my mom had very little money to feed us (total of 8 kids). She would make very simple meals at home. Cooked ground hamburger on bread was a meal we had regularly. There was no extra no frills. Once a month at church we would have a potluck. I remember the joy of getting to try a little of everything. I also remember my mom being stressed out about it. It was always a big deal and she seemed upset. I didn’t find out until recently it was because she was so embarrassed what she could afford to bring. So she would scrimp by that week so she could bring something she felt met the standard. I always remember that other families would get heaping piles of food and my mom was very adamant that we only got what we could eat. She would watch what we took and we would get in trouble if food was left or if we took too much. My parents would comment on how people would pile their plates and then go for seconds. To this day, similar to you, I barely take anything to eat at events. I will take maybe a bite of everything. I will never go back for seconds. There will be so much food and I will leave and realize I am starving. I have recently started to have migraines and one thing they recommend is regulating your blood sugar which means eating more regularly. This is when I realized I have major food trauma and I have a huge fear of eating too much in front of people. To the point I likely have an eating disorder. I only eat normal portions of food when I am with my husband and daughter. I have an aversion to spending money on food while I am out. I have a fear of being fat because people will know I ate too much. It is a hard journey. Take care of yourself. You might want to look at the “Emily Program”.

"Hello Everyone!

I’m moving from India to the US in about a month to start my MS in Human Factors Engineering at Tufts Uni, and I can’t stop feeling anxious about everything. I keep telling myself it’ll be fine, that it’s a step in the right direction, but the closer it gets, the more anxious I get.  

I’m switching fields too, from software engineering (which honestly never felt right for me, felt stagnant and repetitive) to HF, which I actually enjoy (Mostly, I like working on researching and designing, understanding how and why any product is build, how the limits and experiences of users can be taken into consideration etc etc). But it’s a big leap, and even though I know I don’t want to just code for a living anymore, that transition is scary.

My plan isn’t to settle in the US long-term. I’d like to explore, and then come back home in 3 to 4 years. If I don't get to work in the US because of some policy changes or OPT being cancelled or whatever, I'll look for a job elsewhere. But that’s another thing.

Anyway, leaving home makes me sad as well. My dogs are getting older, my grandfather too, and I keep thinking they might feel like I abandoned them when they're ageing. I’ve got all my friends and family here. I’m already earning decently with over 2 years of experience, so it’s not like I have to leave. But I feel stuck, and I know I won’t grow if I stay in the same loop forever.

I’m excited to meet new people, experience a new country, and finally do something I care about but it’s hard not to spiral. I’ll be exhausting most of my savings and a decent chunk of my parents’.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Just needed to get it off my chest. ","It is so normal for big changes to bring up fear, especially as the day approaches when you take that leap. Humans struggle with transitional space. It’s the unknown that scares us, and knowing that once we do it, things wont be exactly the same, maybe we will change too. This is why we begin to mourn and think of loss, because all change is a little taste of loss. the hardest part sometimes is just to go for it. It’s easier on the other side, then you are just living in the decision and not in the transition anymore. Anyway, this will be a big adventure. I think most people regret not having more adventure and sticking to close to what is safe. Go for it!",concur

"I will preface this by saying my mom (66F) has no ""real"" teeth in her mouth except for 1 or 2, the rest are implants. She has been getting these oral surgeries due to genetic bone loss for about 15 years now.

At this point, everything is infected and the dentist says she will need all of them out. There is no point of keeping 1 or 2. I will also say we trust this dentist very much, he's done all of her surgeries and has been our family dentist for 30 years. He is also a professor and teaches at an ivy leage about implants, so I truly feel we are in the best hands.

But I am just nervous for the outcome. She has been through these surgeries before, but not with demenita. I would put her about stage 5, possibly early 6. She has my sister and I and caregivers to help aid during the recovery but I get overwhelmed with this stuff and I am just hoping to see if anyone has any advice.

TIA <3","Made the decision to go ahead with elective knee surgery for my dad (81) back in May. He was in a lot of pain. Got the green light from his primary care doc and neurologist. It seemed like the right choice at the time. What I wish someone had told me is that any type of surgery, anesthesia, or illness can prompt a significant decline. I knew it would be challenging physically, but I didn’t expect the cognitive dropoff. Pre-surgery I would’ve put him at stage 4. Post he is easily stage 5, borderline stage 6. I stayed with him in the hospital and it was one of the worst nights of my life. He kept forgetting he had surgery, tried to pull out his IV, tried to pull off his bandages, tried to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. I was up literally every 10 minutes. Maybe slept a total of an hour. I kept chalking it up to him being in a strange place and figured he’d get better once he was home. When he was discharged, they sent him back to assisted living with my mom. She was apparently not grasping the severity of the situation and let him go to the bathroom by himself and of course he fell. That night he pulled off all his bandages while she slept soundly next to him. (She has been evaluated for dementia and we were told she’s fine.) Days later he was back in the hospital with cracked ribs from the fall and an infection of some sort. Fast forward a few weeks, he’s cleared to move back in to AL with my mom, but quickly declines physically and mentally. He can’t remember where the bathroom is in their 1-bedroom apartment. He’s having accidents. He’s not eating. We’re currently back in the hospital with pneumonia and fluid around his lungs. Palliative care says he’s borderline hospice due to weight loss and cognitive decline. He will go back to the healthcare wing of his AL facility, but will likely stay there permanently. Again, given the information I had at the time, I still think I made the right decision. I just wish I had been more mentally prepared for the aftermath. The cognitive decline from May to now has been substantial. Hard to tell what his new baseline is. There’s a glimmer of hope that he’ll bounce back just a little now that his medical issues have been addressed, but pragmatically I’m expecting the worst.",concur

"So, I work from home.  My med change has been making things hard lately, and impacting my performance.   
I preemptively sent my boss an email saying that I had noticed my output had decreased, and I was leaving a lot of things half finished and incomplete without realizing it. I then asked for possible accommodations, listing a few options. The one that I stated I wanted and personally find the most helpful are short daily check ins. 



In the past, when I asked for this, he had stated that I shouldn't need a babysitter-- that needing someone to monitor me is unsuitable.  I don't want to be monitored, I want visible accountability at the end of the day to help trick my brain into getting everything done.  I don't know why it works, but it helps me an incredible amount.  



Today, he tried to have me break down **why** I thought it would do any good.  He really spent a lot of time trying to talk me out of wanting that one, and offered adjusting my schedule instead.  I had included schedule change on the list since before he had recommended that, even though I do my best work in the early morning, and I very much don't want that. I don't know how it would fix anything, but he really wants me to take a later shift. I would be the only one working that late, which seems like the literal opposite of what I need. 

  
After I explained that currently, I would like the check in for a kind of reality check, because I can't trust my judgement, he asked how long I would want, and I said I didn't know, maybe two months if everything went slowly with the meds. He stated this would be an unreasonably long time and burden on someone. 

Is it really such an unreasonable request?  Is there anything else I can do by myself? A strong, consistent check in with repercussions of accountability I don't know how to do alone.

Asking them for a daily check-in, in their perspective, might be seen as another thing they now have to do, all because you're unable to do the work, and is now another load/stress on their plate. Not saying you've done anything wrong asking for a daily check in, some bosses may even appreciate it, ones who like to know the going ons and especially in roles that are more complex and where day to day things can have big impacts (my old job was like this), im simply giving you another perspective that some work places/bosses will have.",concur

I'm 25 btw, the 35 is a typo!!

So I'm in a healthy relationship and have been for almost 4 years. We live together and we're planning on buying a house and getting married.

The person I was with before this relationship was a long time childhood friend who broke up with me suddenly, out of the blue with little explanation.

I was very surprised and upset about the break up at the time and never got any closure as to why he ended things.

As we were childhood friends, we shared a friendship group and have continued to share a friendship group, meaning we are often at the same social events together but I deliberately don't speak directly to him or seek out any interaction with him, as I feel like our friendship ended when our relationship did, but I do keep things civil.

He started to date another girl in my friendship group recently and I was speaking to her and explaining how I was happy for her as she has been dating a string of horrible (almost abusive) men and I was glad that she was choosing a safe guy.

She then confessed to me that she has been sleeping with him for years and that they actually slept together when me and him were dating. She told me that the reason why he broke up with me suddenly was because he felt guilty for cheating on me and that he had been confiding in her that he wanted to break up with me because he felt bad about sleeping with her.

She was surprised that this was news to me and I tried to keep a poker face, and not seem upset.

I now feel conflicted, on the one hand, this was over 4 years ago, almost 5 years probably, and I'm in a happy and healthy relationship, but I now feel so blindsided by this, especially as she was someone I considered a friend.

I've not spoken to my partner about this because I don't want him to think I'm still hungup on my past relationships.

Edit; thanks for all the advice and reassurance! I spoke to my current boyfriend about it, a few hours ago and he was really understanding and supportive. We then went on a nice walk and had a nap (we're both a bit hungover). I think I'm going to take a break from seeing all of that group for a while and then *maybe* try and figure out who knew but I think that it may just upset me further. I've got other friends and a nicer, happier life. I think I was just so shocked by how two people I've known for over ten years could surprise me in such a horrible way. Oh well! I guess you never really know people. Thank you Reddit for making me feel less insane! ❤️💗","She 💯 knew what she was doing when she told you. To be honest, shes probably jealous that you landed on your feet and she's still just with your trash.

“We do want to give patients hope that this drug will continue in its clinical development path,” von Stein said. He acknowledged that Berlin Cures’ Phase 2 trial was “not an optimum study in design” and said that future research will learn from its shortcomings.""

"Hi everyone,

Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a new library and research paper that unify structure-preserving matrix transformations within a high-dimensional framework (hypersphere and hypercubes).

Today I’m excited to share: MatrixTransformer—a Python library and paper built around a 16-dimensional decision hypercube that enables smooth, interpretable transitions between matrix types like

* Symmetric
* Hermitian
* Toeplitz
* Positive Definite
* Diagonal
* Sparse
* ...and many more

It is a lightweight, structure-preserving transformer designed to operate directly in 2D and nD matrix space, focusing on:

* Symbolic & geometric planning
* Matrix-space transitions (like high-dimensional grid reasoning)
* Reversible transformation logic
* Compatible with standard Python + NumPy

It simulates transformations without traditional training—more akin to procedural cognition than deep nets.

# What’s Inside:

* A unified interface for transforming matrices while preserving structure
* Interpolation paths between matrix classes (balancing energy & structure)
* Benchmark scripts from the paper
* Extensible design—add your own matrix rules/types
* Use cases in ML regularization and quantum-inspired computation

# Links:

"On mobile so sorry for poor formatting.

TLDR; My older siblings have always acted like I don’t exist and now feel obligated to my time, yet refuse to reach out to me first and claim I’ve shunned them. Told my sister that they’ve never treated me like family, so I don’t feel obligated to do the same, and it’s causing some riffs. I don’t want to play telephone anymore and wanna make that clear that they aren’t shunned, but I don’t owe them anything. Any advice?


I (23F) come from a very large and dysfunctional family, I have 4 siblings and we share the same mother, myself the only one with a different father, and all of my siblings are 10+ years older than I am, so by the time I was old enough to form memories most of them were already in high school or moving out of the house. Growing up I’ve always felt somewhat of a black sheep or an outcast, whether that was because of the age differences, or that I didn’t share a father, or maybe purely because they were sick of my mom having more kids. They never really acknowledged me unless they had to, didn’t really hang out with me, shooed me away every chance they had, even lowkey tortured me as a toddler by locking me in closets and other crazy shit like that so they wouldn’t have to babysit me, etc. 

I was a fairly perceptive kid, I was constantly trying to earn approval somehow, but as I got older I realized that they really didn’t have any interest in being my siblings, and it was more like I was just the mutt my mom decided to keep. Once, when I was 13, my mom admitted to me that when my siblings found out she was pregnant, they immediately told her to get an abortion. I stopped trying so hard, tired of hurting my own feelings from their rejection, and by the time I was in high school I had barely any line of communication with most of my siblings. 

The only one I can give any credit to was my sister Martha (34F), who was the youngest before I was. She was 11 when I was born, and I was her little buddy for the most part until she moved away for college, and even after she moved back to our hometown, she kept an open line of communication with me, in case I ever needed another adult. She took me in at 16 so I could finish high school, after suffering from one of the worst blow out fights of the decade with my mom, deeming it unsafe for me to return home, and we grew closer than ever as I got older.

She was the only sibling who reached out when my dad died earlier this year, and even helped cover some of his funeral costs, plus paid some of my bills when I was going under from all the stress. I owe a lot to her, and I remind her all the time how much I appreciated her stepping up for me when no one else would, despite having significantly less money and time to devote to me than the rest of our siblings, she did everything she could. 

My birthday is coming up in a week, my sister Katherine’s (45F) birthday is 3 days before mine, so Martha recently reminded me to not forget to tell Katherine happy birthday this year. I kinda raised an eyebrow at her, because I never told her I forgot the year before, meaning Katherine must’ve said something to her about it. I told her straight up that Katherine has forgotten my birthday for the past 5 years, so I don’t see why she’d care if she hears from me or not, considering we’re not even really family anyway. The last bit seemed to rub Martha wrong, and she immediately asked what I meant by that. 

I laid it out plainly and told her that Katherine is honestly a stranger to me, we haven’t had an actual conversation in over 6 years, and she refuses to reach out to me first despite being a grown woman, she always has to say something to Martha to relay to me; I wouldn’t really consider that familial communication. Same goes for the rest of them, we haven’t had an actual interaction face to face or even over the phone in just as long, and they’re just as uninvolved in my life as I am theirs, using Martha as a messenger instead of talking to me themselves. Martha tried to wave it off, saying that regardless we’re still related, we’re all still a family, and I can be the bigger person and rise above our siblings’ immature behavior since I have a good head on my shoulders. I flat out told her that no, we aren’t a family, we were never raised to be that way, we’re just a group of people who happened to come out of the same woman. I said that I may be a part of Martha’s family, but I’m not apart of OUR family that we share, and it’s always been made apparent to me.

The convo continued with Martha telling me that I won’t get what I don’t give, and I said the same goes for them, they’re all adults with their own lives and so am I, yet they all make the time to talk to each other, excluding me. I’ve essentially lived my entire life with them not caring about my existence and that it really doesn’t make a difference to me whether they ever reach out to me or not. I didn’t want to continue arguing with her, because I knew that we were just going to have to agree to disagree, so I told her I’ll consider them family when they decide they finally wanna do the same for me and show they genuinely care, not just because they feel I owe them my time solely because they’re older and I’m younger. Since then, Martha hasn’t brought up Katherine, but her husband did tell me that she told Katherine about what I said and now she’s crying to our other siblings wondering “where they went wrong enough to be shunned by OP for no reason.”

I wanna make it clear that they’re not “shunned”, they follow my social medias, they have my phone number, my mailing address, they can reach out anytime if they want to hear from me so badly or feel entitled to my time, but they don’t, and I frankly have enough going on right now that speaking to any of them is the last thing on my mind. I know Martha probably feels hurt and somewhat lumped in with the rest of them from my statement, and I want to apologize to her, but I also want to make it clear to her and our other siblings that I’m not playing telephone with them anymore. I need to make it apparent that I’m noting shunning them, but I frankly owe them nothing.

Any advice for how I can go about this without making it seem like I’m trying to cut them all off? And not like I’m rolling over for them? I’ll take what I can get, thanks.

"Location:  Oregon

On 06-01 I started working in this workplace, with a 2 year contract. This type of work requires custom tools per worker, which the company pays for.

The contract says that if you willingly don't work the time, without proper reason (health reasons or other manager approved situations) you are responsible to reimburse the company. This applies if you miss 20% of your hours in a 31 day span.

And you are liable for any overtime paid to others that have to finish your job, if you don't work with the proper reason.

If you get fired, you aren't responsible for the cost of tools or overpay. And with permission can take the tools with you.

On 07-02 I got in to an conflict with a coworker. The reason for the conflict had risen when he tried to give me tasks that weren't my job to handle.

He made a complaint to one of the managers (I had a direct manager, who this person wasn't), and I got fired. Reason being as this wasn't the first complaint about me, which in theory wouldn't surprise me.

On 07-10 I got a call from my direct manager asking why I wasn't in for a week. I explained the situation, and he said that the other manager doesn't have power to fire me. And that I am in breach of contract.

I have the firing in writing in my email, but the call went so fast I forget to get to it.

My direct manager said something close to ""As this is a legal issue now, all our contract must go through our legal department. Please don't come in, as that would be trespassing.""

It’s often questions about such irrelevant things that really make no difference and he doesn’t need to know the answers to them.

For example, I would say that I will text him later because I need to save my phone data while being outside. And he will ask all the stuff about how much data do I have per month, why do I need to save it, how much does my plan cost, how much do I use per day etc. This obviously makes no difference to him and to me it just feels like a waste of time and energy having to explain everything to him. I understand the more sensible topics like about my health if he’s asking a lot of details about my doctors appointment but things like this just really annoy me that I just don’t even want to respond but idk if i can tell him that. 

Maybe it’s to do with the fact that in my only serious relationship before this my ex partner was very nonchalant and never really cared or showed any interest in what im doing. But this time it feels like a different extreme. Is it normal when ur partner asks so many questions? Or am i being a bitch for getting annoyed?

Tldr: boyfriend always asks questions about irrelevant topics and i get annoyed and dont have the guts to tell him that he doesn’t need to know everything. ",how many ml of pee have u pee today? what is the colour of your stool? how many breath have you taken since u wake up?,concur
"I am still coming to realize that the vast majority of the challenges in my relationship w my wife and son are because of my behaviors and thinking patterns. I struggle w not being defensive and sometimes I even succeed. I regularly have difficulties thinking outside of myself and it’s a problem within our home. 

Yet, the 3% of the time where I’m in the right,  or I have a valid point, I don’t even get THAT acknowledgment. I made to feel like I’m always the problem even though that’s objectively untrue.

"Location: Illinois


My dad married his ex-wife when I was 17. She was a stereotypical people-user and she told my mom, in front of me, that she taught her daughters you marry for money not love. Dear dad didn't get the memo. He said he made her sign a pre-nup so he thought he was golden and she was so perfect and blah blah blah. She turned him against my sisters and I to the point we really didn't have a relationship for ~13 years, until she filed for divorce and got around the prenup. He said there's a law that let's your spouse work around the prenuptial after 14 years. I don't know. She took everything from him including the inheritance my grandmother left entirely to him with a verbal instruction to divide amongst me and my sisters/his half siblings. Spoilers alert, he kept everything and then shared it with his wife and left my sisters and I to struggle and figure things out on our own. Which we did, but it wasn't easy. 


When they divorced my father also had gotten an Alzheimers diagnosis. When we started trying to help take care of him (begrudgingly on my part, willingly on my sister's) he swore he had taken care of fixing the will. He wasn't too far gone in the diagnosis yet, so we thought he did. Hindsight is 20-20.


My dad passed away a few months ago. My sister has been in charge of his estate and she found out the hard way that my dad never updated his will. The will that he had filled out most recently was thankfully voided because it left 1/3 of the estate to me and everything else to his ex wife. The new one has 1/3 to me, 1/3 to one sister and 1/3 to a 3rd party that won't be revealed to us but no one else in our family has come forth with it, including 2 half sisters who called Just to see if they were the 3rd beneficiary. They were not. Which leads us to ex wife. 


The inheritance is small for us, around $8000 a piece. His pension however is not being given to either of us. I don't know anything about estate law. My father worked for the state and I've been told his pension is like ~$100k. Is there any standing we would have to contest this? I don't even necessarily want the money though of course it would help. But that woman has stolen so much from our family, including the relationship with our dad. She doesn't deserve this.

I (23f) really never thought I would ever make a mistake like this. I have been cheated on before and I know how bad it hurts. Im still wondering about whether or not I was also taken advantage of by my ex bf (22m). 

Me and my ex bf broke up and we had been on and off with no contact for about 6 months. Around a month or 2 ago my ex reaches out one morning and we decided to meet up just to talk. He told me I was under appreciated and taken for granted and he wanted to close out our contact by talking about it. 

Earlier in the day (on the phone) I laid out the boundary of “no weird shit” because at the time I had a bf (23m). He knew this.
Me and my ex got to talking about the past, good memories and bad and somewhere along the line he leans in to kiss me. To which I lean away. In the moment I was caught up on whether or not I actually wanted to kiss him. He kept leaning in at various moments and I would lean/turn away. At one point I even lightly pushed his face away. 

He kept complimenting me saying “You look so beautiful right now, come on kiss me” and “You know you want to” and it really got in my head.

At this point I still couldn’t tell if I wanted to kiss him. I felt like he was playing with me so I tried to hit back by saying “If you had any balls, you would just do it” and he did it. 

For a second, it felt like I could’ve had him back but he didn’t stick around. After a few days I realized he just wanted to use me as a rebound. He broke up with his then gf a little bit before he reached out. I felt horrible for even being there that day. The fact that I even met up with my ex without telling my bf was cause enough for me to understand that I wasn’t ready for/deserving of a relationship. That night I told my then boyfriend everything that happened and he split. I didn’t blame him one bit. 

Anyway, it doesn’t feel good. My then bf was very patient in the ways I struggled. He supported me in so many ways in such a short amount of time. Being with him felt like an adventure where I didn’t have to think about the ways my ex bf hurt me or how I hurt him. I don’t know how to continue in the actions of processing all this and recovering. 

I hate the idea of being on a “healing journey” because I feel like I have been “healing” for two years straight at a snails pace.  I like to often believe that pain exists to make room for happiness but I’m not too confident I deserve to heal and be happy.

"Hello r/GetMotivated,

As I (21F) mentioned in the title, I cannot really grasp the concept of enjoying the process of achieving goals. I just achieve goals, no matter how I do it. If i really need it, and if the effort is worth the goal for me, I do it, or if it's not worth it, I don't. I have ADHD and autism (if it's important)

I'll give couple of examples below

1. I work as a software developer intern. I do my job to get the money and to validate my university year (it's a requirement). I couldn't care less about the enjoyment of what I'm doing, I just know that I have to do it so that I finish my year and get my monthly pay. I'm not happy with the pay, but this was the highest paid internship.

How can I even enjoy the process of working, when the only thing I wish for is money to then be able to do what I actually like? It's not like I dislike IT: I've liked it ever since I was a child, and I still do it as a hobby sometimes, but ugh... How do you enjoy if it's work? I doubt anyone would've enjoyed flipping burgers in McDonald's or something. It's just work

2. I like to play games, but as soon as they become challenging, I stop playing. It feels like a waste of time and effort to try to win a game that's too challenging. Winning too easy is not enjoyable too, but it feels much better than always losing while trying to do the impossible.

Like, I have no idea why do I hate losing so much.

3. I hate to walk. I'm in good health, but walking feels like such a waste of time. People always associate ""enjoying the process"" with walking, ""taking a stroll"", that it feels nice and so. I've broken my brain trying to understand what they meant, because for me walking is just the thing that gets me from point A to point B, nothing more. Maybe I'll see something interesting around, but I for sure would NEVER go out without a reason, just to take a walk. I always HAVE to have a reason to go out: go grocery shopping, go get that board game, go eat out, etc., or else I will feel like I'm spending the time I have left on this planet on something that doesn't make me feel good. I even taught myself to make wider steps at some point, so I would spend as less time en-route as possible

It feels like my brain is trying to maximise the dopamine from doing as little effort as possible. While it's only natural, it feels like it's extreme, compared to other people, even people with ADHD. Everything has to be optimised, or I'd hate it.

I'm on my second psychologist now, and it seems like they cannot help me to find the reason why I'm feeling like this, despite helping me immensely with other things. 

If I want something, I'll do effort to get it, if it's not too much effort and if I'll get more dopamine than negative emotions from the hard path of achieving the goal. I have no trouble doing boring and mundane things, I always do them. My house is not always clean, but is for sure clean when I'm determined to make it clean.

The reason why I want to understand what's really ""enjoying the process"" is because I'm starting to realise that I could enjoy my life more than I actually do, but I don't know how.

I've always been like this. I don't have TikTok or other video scrolling apps like that, I prefer reading long articles over watchign a video of someone explaining them, etc. I don't have a problem focusing on anything

Can you relate? Did you find your answer? Don't hesitate to leave comments


Edit: forgot to mention that I have plenty of other hobbies besides programming that I sometimes do, not all the time. I rotate between them, and pick one if it feels enjoyable. No problem in enjoying the process there","Try meditation. Just sit very still and listen with your mind and your ears. Focus. That's it. Focus on any sound or vibration you hear, and try to bring it forward into more clarity. Occasionally observe how you are feeling in that moment. Observe your thoughts coming and going but try not to chase or interact with them. Alternate between these 2 states of focus and observation. This is how you learn to exist more in the present moment, and as a by product, enjoy the process, whatever that process may be. Think of it like learning to be in a hyper zoomed in state, where time moves slower for you. The key to a good life is learning how to be more in the present, and by that I mean, learning to take in and process more and more information from all senses, in smaller and smaller increments of time. You mentioned walking. Stop for a moment, and become aware of everything going on around you in that place, in that moment. Look at all the details. Focus. Take it all in. That is what you are missing if you just go from A to B as fast as possible. You're not really living, you're just a npc, going through the motions. You're missing everything that is going on around you, every second... This is going to be counter to everything you believe. It might scramble your brain. Understand that you are only ever rendered in the present frame. The present is all that matters. So you need to learn how to fully exist in the present, and you do that via awareness.

"I get asked about what side effects I'm suffering, but, even if I directly ask for help dealing with them, I, at best, get brushed off with suggestions that obviously wouldn't work or make it clear they haven't looked at my medical history. At worst, they just explain why I'm experiencing the symptom in question, and that's it. 

Then there was today's chemo treatment. 

To put it bluntly, my arm started hurting  and it was clear, to me, that it was due to the infusion going into a too small vein too fast. I've experienced this before. It hurts, a lot. Stoping it involves either reducing the flow or moving the site to a bigger vein.

But, no matter how many times I explained this to the nurse, she kept bringing up burning sensations being normal for some chemo drugs. She didn't seem to want to hear ""there's no burning sensation.""

Her ""solutions"" were 1)add saline to the mix, 2)add a much lower volume of saline to the mix, and 3)add a second line in my other hand, in about the same spot as the line that's giving me problems, and run different drugs in there.

She got annoyed and left, with a parting ""I'll come back when you've decided what you want to do"", when I wouldn't let her do 3.

I managed to get the attention of someone else, who sent someone over to move the line to a spot on my arm, which fixed the problem. 

The original nurse came back and acted like nothing happened. 

I have one more chemo session left (knock on wood) and I'm considering wearing gloves.

I have a whole other vent about the radiation treatment, but I'll spare you. 
","When you say gloves have you considered boxing gloves for wayward providers? (sorry to any nurses on the thread, I couldn't help myself- it doubly applies to clueless docs). You present a very reasonable complaint to someone who is either burnt out or having a bad day. It is not your job to make their day better. It is their job to make your day better- that is the essence of being in healthcare. Even if you had an unreasonable request (which you didn't), it is their job to deal with your suffering in a compassionate way. The sincere phrase ""I wish there was more I could do for you in this situation"" was one I learned far too late in my career. It is an honest statement of shared humanity and the reality of our shared suffering. In short, this person failed you on this day. Having said that there is enough suffering to go around. 20% of doctors and nurses quit during covid and over 50% of the remaining consider themselves burnt out. As a retired doc I see that the demands placed on healthcare staff today cause Moral Injury in Healthcare (look it up if interested)- it is beyond sad. I spent a few decades looking at healthcare on 6 continents as I practiced- no place is perfect. it is fascinating to me to see the differences in how present or absent providers can be in the three healthcare systems I now get care. It gives me great empathy for the doctors in nurses who have to work in the least provider and patient friendly of the three (recent local newspaper article suggests that I am not the only one to notice this relationship). I guess I would have one piece of advice if you are looking for it- trust your gut and continue to advocate for yourself in a pleasant but firm manner. I present to healthcare as a retired doctor so my situation is not identical. I opted for a port early on which was the single best thing I did for myself. If I did not I would have asked them to stop the infusion, call the doctor, and discuss what options we have including injecting some lidocaine into the line before resuming the infusion, medicating me for the pain, changing IV sites,... Pretty quickly your suggestion to restart the IV becomes the solution to their problem of calling the doctor. Your job is not to create a new friend with a burnt out healthcare provider- it is to glide as smoothly through this troubled healthcare system as you can. I worry there is little you or I can do to change the negative trajectory of healthcare over the next decade.",concur

"I just watched something that completely changed how I think about ApoE4 and Alzheimer's risk.

For years, we've been told that carrying ApoE4 means one thing: dramatically higher Alzheimer's risk. Period. End of story.

But what if that's only half true?

Dr. Aura Ramirez just presented research that shows ApoE4 behaves COMPLETELY differently depending on your ancestry. Not just ""a little different""—we're talking about fundamental molecular changes in how the gene functions.

Here's what blew my mind:

🧬 **Discovery #1: African ancestry contains a ""genetic brake"" that naturally suppresses ApoE4 expression.** When researchers used CRISPR to remove this brake, ApoE4 expression shot up, but ONLY in African cells. European cells? No change.



🧠 **Discovery #2: In European and African brains, ApoE4 creates a dangerous imbalance:** ramping up cholesterol production while shutting down myelin (the insulation that keeps your neurons firing properly). It's like building more gas stations while letting the highways crumble.



🌎 **Discovery #3: Amerindian brain cells flip the entire script.** Their ApoE4 actually REDUCES cholesterol pathways and INCREASES myelination. Same gene, opposite effect.



**This is both fascinating science AND hope.**

Because if some populations have naturally evolved protection against ApoE4, maybe we can learn to replicate it. Maybe risk isn't as fixed as we thought. Maybe your genes aren't your destiny after all.

I've been diving deep into this research, and just posted a full breakdown on YouTube.

**If you carry ApoE4, or care about someone who does, this might be the most important 15 minutes you spend today. Remember to share it if you believe it might help someone else!**

Because the more we understand about how ancestry shapes genetic risk, the closer we get to truly personalized prevention.

"Throwaway account. I (32M) and my girlfriend (33F) have been dating for 3 years now and have been close friends for 5-6 years. We’ve been living together for more than a year and it’s been phenomenal. 

Some background: I’ve been working in research labs for a decade now. I do not personally work with rats at the moment, but many labs in the building do, so it is not uncommon to see large transport carts full with live rodents. They're large carts with dozens of clear cages with mice or rats. There is specific smell when the rat cart has been around- it lingers in the elevator and the hallway for a few minutes after the cart has passed. I have only ever smelled this smell in a laboratory hallway or elevator. It's not unpleasant, it is just distinctly rat cart. I had guinea pigs as a kid, grew up in a home with a mouse problem, and have played with my friend's pet rats, all of which have a specific smell, none of which smell like lab rodent. 

We are both incredibly horny. We fuck like rabbits, almost every day. I eat her out all the time, as it is one of my favorite things to do. About 3 months ago, I noticed a different smell coming from her than usual. Nothing crazy, but different. IT took me a few days, but I finally placed the smell. LAB RODENT. Her v4gina smells like lab rodent. I figured she might have been coming down with a UTI or something, so I asked her if she had any discomfort. She said no. She's super open with me about these things, and over the years of our friendship and then romance I've brought her cranberry juice and monistat multiple times and she's always been open about these kind of things.  She actually was the first person I told that I have had an STD, and she was totally chill with it and supportive. On the topic of that STD, my ex boyfriend ended up passing it to me because he was cheating on me. She has also been cheated on before, and our history is one of the many reasons for the transparency in our relationship.  I mention this because I know there will be comments telling me that she's cheating on me and that's why she smells different. I trust her implicitly. She's not cheating on me, and if she had, which I have no reason to believe she has, we'd just talk about it. Besides, what would that mean? That that guy has a rat dick? 

I thought that I might have a rat dick. After all, I work in a lab. I come home smelling like chemicals because I mount tumors on slides all day. I wear a lab coat, leave my shoes at the door, immediately shower when I get home and put my work clothes in a separate hamper. It's not like I work with infectious disease, but it just makes sense to keep things separate. I do not smell like lab rat at all. I have asked her if I smell ok dozens of times, and she says that I smell like I usually do. I asked her to elaborate, and she said I smell like skin and soap. Lab rodent does not smell like skin and soap. 

There's not really a way she would have been in contact with lab animals on her own- she works a 9-5 in marketing (which she KILLS at). No stories of work or coworkers or friends or enemies or her spin class or any of her general going on's have ever given me any inkling that they involve rodents. 

I googled rodent v4gina and regretted it instantly. I don't know why I did that. Dead end. Nothing I know about the female body has prepared me for this. Every single article I have read about a change in smell has lead to nothing. I have been desperately trying to find a change in our life that would have resulted in this change. She has not changed her diet, birth control, supplements, or clothing in the past 3 months. The scent goes away on her period but comes back when it's done. I do the laundry and have not changed any products. Toilet paper is the same, there's no smell in her underwear drawer when I was putting her clothes away, her shampoo/conditioner/bodywash/bodylotion/sunscreen are ALL the same as always. I feel like I'm going nuts, and she's noticed how weird I've been. She hasn't brought it up yet, but I can see that she's looking at me funny when I do weird stuff like this. It's impacted our sex life, which isn't the end of the world, but I know it's making her worry about me. 

How in god's name do I bring this up to her? Do I bring it up to her? I would do it immediately if I thought that it was dangerous. I'm not concerned with safety, I'd just bewildered. I'd be making an observation on the most sensitive part of her body for my own curiosity. How do I even say that? Good morning beautiful, coffee’s in the pot, eggs on the stove, you have rat pussy?

"my a/c has not worked at all this year and I can’t afford to fix it. I have been getting by with 3 small table fans (not the big box fans) running 24/7. I keep one in my kitchen and 2 in my bedroom. I have to leave them running even when I’m at work or it’s unbearable when I get home. I thought that at least I was saving money on electricity since I can’t use the a/c. I just received my electric bill and it jumped from June (average 16 kwh per day) to July (average 80 kWh per day). These are based on actual meter readings, not estimates. Total charge this month is $323.70. 

Temperatures have mostly been in the high 90s and there have been many local heat advisories, just to give you an idea. 

Am I this stupid that I thought 3 fans would use less electricity than a whole house a/c unit? Man this sucks! I’ve been taking cold showers before I go to bed every night just to get some sleep and I’m sweating buckets all day and somehow this is all costing me more? ","I don't think this adds up right. Assuming 30 days of billing that means you used 1,920 kWh MORE this billing cycle than last billing cycle. There are 720 hours in a 30 day cycle which means you averaged 2.67 kWh more every hour of every day. Split across three fans and that's almost 900 watts per fan. A standard household outlet (and circuit) can handle about 1,800 watts (15 amps at 120 volts). That means if you plugged both fans into the same circuit (like your bedroom) you would be maxing that circuit all day every day (dangerous, can cause outlets to melt, etc) and if you plugged the 3rd one into the bedroom as the same time and turned them all on, it would trip the breaker box. Now, it could be that the refrigerator is working a lot harder to keep cool if the house is like 90 degrees or more compared to if the house is 70 degrees, but even that I don't think would use that much power. What I would be worried about is if the air conditioner *has* been running this whole time but doesn't have any refrigerant in it or something so it's just blowing room temperature air. OR, the indoor air handler (what moves the air around) isn't working but somehow the compressor outside is still turning on and off.",concur
"It's almost kinda impressive how after years of medications, talk therapy, DBT, CBT, eating better, exercising, trying different hobbies, trying to go out more, trying to stay in more, huge lifestyle changes, bring independent, EMDR, a few group therapies, a hospitalization, substance abuse, stopping substance abuse, and now a full round of TMS treatments- I still want to kill myself. Sometimes it's better but I still don't see myself succeeding. I don't see myself as a loveable person worth anyone's time platonically or otherwise on my best days. I don't have friends or much contact with my family and I don't really care about changing that anymore. How do I keep dragging myself along? I'm about to hit my 30s.

"Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.

This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.

"I’m 27, and I feel like my life has already ended. I’m just dragging out what’s left of it until I hit the deadline I gave myself which is age 30. If things don’t change by then, I’m done. I’ve made peace with that.

There was a time I actually lived. I had friends I loved, nights full of laughter, hours lost in games that made me feel connected, present, human. I used to have goals. I cared about things. I was excited to wake up. I was curious about the world and my place in it.

Now there’s nothing. I’ve lost everyone. The people I used to be close with have vanished. The things that brought me joy feel dead. I try to play games and I just sit there, empty. Music doesn’t move me. I barely eat. I barely sleep. I barely feel.

Every day blends into the next. I watch time pass, but I’m not really in it. Just surviving out of habit.

I set 30 as the point where if nothing changes, I walk away from it all. Three years left. And honestly? I don’t see anything getting better. I think I already know how this ends.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe just to mark the fact that I was here, that I used to be someone.

He told me I just “stubbornly” stick to my own ideas without consulting people with more experience than me. He says my brother is doing way better than me because he listened instead of blindly going his own way.

Hearing him say that pisses me the fuck off. **Do I follow my own plans? No! I didn’t fucking do anything I wanted to do. I didn’t follow my parents’ advice, nor did I follow anyone else’s, including my own. I wish I could follow my own plans.** If I did, I’d be way happier now.

He thinks my problem is not knowing what to do or being oblivious to how the world works.

"I was diagnosed probably 2 years ago and started taking meds immediately. I also do a lot of independent research so I can fully understand all of my symptoms. Lately, I have been feeling like my ADHD paralysis has gotten worse. It's really only on the days where I take a break from my meds. Before I was diagnosed I had a lot of problems getting up and starting tasks, but I could still do it after I had a brief fight with my brain. Now, on days off of my meds, sometimes I don't get out of bed until noon and I maybe do 1 or 2 tasks. I've been trying to research this and haven't found many resources so I thought I would turn here. I think sometimes community and life experiences can be more useful than scientific research anyway. So has anyone else had this problem?

The only thing I could really find was about tolerance and dependency. I will admit that I do love my meds. When I started taking them I finally felt like a real person who could do normal things just like everyone else. However, I would be happy to switch if it were in best interest to my health. So, psychologically I don't think I am dependent. Maybe physically I am though and that's why on off days it's harder for me to manage my symptoms than it was before?

So you will never naturally compare to them. I started with floor goals. Reduce the scope of your expectations and intentionally, very intentionally be easy on yourself and motivated to do only the one thing that day.

It gives me enough momentum to continue with smaller tasks that eventually get into more focused tasks. Like picking up that dish on my desk that’s sat there for a day, or loading the laundry. It’s like building momentum to switch to the Active Network in your brain, something that is tough for people with ADHD. Your working memory is hampered with ADHD because your Default Mode Network is leaking into your awareness when you’re trying to get things done. To save the effort to wrestle your attention, have places (physically or digitally) that you can come back to later to reference or start doing what you need to do immediately. Bigger projects need to be systemically organized so that the effort to start working on it is used to actually think or do instead of going through the work of getting setup.

"I have a trip planned with my family to Europe in October.  It's basically my bucket list trip.  

Every time I talk to my mom, and the trip comes up, she says, ""Are you sure you'll feel well enough?""

Listen, if I ONLY did things when I felt well enough, I'd never do anything again.

I've been treating my cancer for more than 4 years.  Stage IV for the last 2 1/2 years.  And for the last 6 months I've been getting chemo and a targeted treatment that kicks my ass every 3 weeks.

The reality is, I never feel good anymore.  I'm always tired, always in some pain, and always just had or am just about to go in for an infusion.  

So I'll probably never feel good enough to do things again, but I still want to do them.  So I put on my big girl pants, and I make plans, and I may need to take a lot of breaks, but I go on the trip.

"Howdy;

I (22M) graduated university with a Bachelor's in psychology just over a year ago, but didn't have the money to justify launching into a doctorate yet. About six months ago, I was hired to serve on the floor of a medical clinic.

The pay is twice my previous job through college (restaurant work) but has been grueling for my health. 12 hour shifts starting as early as 4 AM, immense stress in trying to take care of patients while some are actively hostile to my efforts, weight gain, etc. I've seen two people pass away and have been deeply tempted to drink to cope. Yesterday, I had to leave early because the stress made me physically ill to the point of vomiting at work. My apologies if this breaks the sob story rule, but I mean it for the context of how hard it's been mentally/physically.

The problem is that I am deeply concerned what will happen if I leave. I've been applying to numerous jobs and have a couple interviews lined up, but nothing is promised. I want to try sticking it out until something is certain but the sheer dread the thought of going back there for weeks or potentially months is enough to sicken me all over again. I don't have a doctor to ask for a MLOA, but maybe 3-6 months in savings depending on how tightly I can cut back expenses. I am also concerned about the potential gap in my resume if I don't find something soon after quitting even if I can afford to.

I feel like I rambled but the TL;DR is my job is extremely draining and depressing to the point of physical danger but unemployment scares me too.

"My partner and i have been dealing with Long Covid for 3.5 years, i developed it, a seriously broken immune system as well as CFS amongst 80 other symptoms ... she felt helpless.

**I know it has been difficult for her, she voiced this and we always sat down and spoke about everything in a safe space, at the very start she wanted to walk away "" How is our life going to look if you cant get better ? ""**

**I completely understand, chronic illness is a life sentence in most cases ... you have to adapt and accept your life will change, maybe she couldnt.**

**I said "" if it doesnt get better in 2 years i will walk away , it wouldnt be fair for you to be stuck to a sick man for life ""**

**Whenever she had difficulties with it we would sit and talk, understandably for the first year we spent very little time together, my suffering was immense it was all i could do to just stay alive ... after that though i made the effort needed to still spend time together regardless of how shit i felt, board game nights, movie nights, cooking nights, walking outside as much as i could with CFS, picnics by the lake. Pushing myself to limits that i shouldnt have and that often really pushed my baseline back.**

**I was there for her through this whole thing, when i should have been there for myself. All i ever wanted was for her to be happy, safe and loved. It was always my number 1 priority.**

Before the illness we climbed mountains, wild camped, constantly outdoors together. We started healing our past traumas, working on real growth, planning the future, i even started learning her language.

We had our difficulties like everybody else but there was real love there ... Don't get me wrong i understand it wasn't easy, our life became difficult overnight, we could no longer socialise and do things as a couple. Even catching a flu could have had serious consequences, for the first year i was unable to breath, walk or talk without great difficulty ... doctors could not help me - they said and i quote ..

**"" We know what it is we just dont know why it happens so we can't help you, all you can do is go home and hope it gets better ""**

After that i knew i was on my own and refused to just roll over and die, i spent countless hours researching everything i could get my hands on all while suffering the most immense symptoms, we counted 80 at one point. Honestly i made sure it impacted on her life as little as possible, still financially payed my half ... still dragged my broken body out into nature when i could, cleaning when i couldnt breath and struggled to walk.

I encouraged her regularly to go out and enjoy life, grow and go on holiday with friends, i would catch up when my illness was better. I even supported her financially when i really couldnt. I know it was hard for her and i know she developed depression. I started to get therapy for my worries about my illness and the future and encouraged her to speak to someone as well.. she never did.

**The thing is there was 0 Caregiving At least not in the sense you think, i wouldnt allow it ... i needed it, by god i needed it but i couldn't let it disrupt our lives more than it already had.**

**I struggled to cook and feed myself - i did it anyway.**

**I struggled to shower or bath - i did it anyway.**

**I struggled to walk - i pushed myself anyway, relearning how to walk.**

**I struggled to talk or form words - i relearned myself.**

**I struggled financially - i payed my side of everything through the whole situation, i never allowed her to support me financially.**

The only thing i ever needed for her was to pick up a few things in town that i couldnt get delievered once a month.

3.5 years in i am 85% better and looking at real remission next year.

**Our lives were back to a semi social state, our sex life was in full swing, i was starting to make serious plans for next year in regards to our lives.**

**Heres the kicker, she went away to a retreat the other week and took a hefty dose of mushrooms..** Before she left she was this incredibly sweet, loving, caring partner that had light in her eyes, all in all the woman i knew and loved.

**She came back the total opposite .. Cold, Never sat down, Always on the go, i quite literally saw her for maybe 3 hours in 2 weeks before she went on her next holiday .. almost 0 empathy, for us .. The light in her eyes had just gone.**

She apparently met someone at this retreat and felt things for them, they got close. I have no idea how close, she said they just shared some hugs and talks about how they feel things for each other, then they were messaging after the retreat .. which seems like madness to me ... she was there for 7 days compared to our 7 years.

She said that was the catalyst for her, she had cheated on her past partner a few times and felt that at that point if she was feeling something for someone else something had changed, she asked for an open relationship when she got back ... **she said she could stay with me if she could meet with this other person and do the things our life was lacking socially. She said "" I know if i spend time with this person i will explore it on a physical level also and i want to ""**

**I was honestly shocked and horrified ... wtf happened to the woman i love ???**

I wasn't ok with that, i honestly considered it just before she left for her holiday last week then she completely did a 180 and said actually no i need to find myself... It was a huge head fuck ...

She told me she wanted to leave and that she had lost herself. I asked if she would like to take one of our walks by the river before she goes on holiday and we could talk ... We had a talk about everything and at the end of it i asked..

**"" If we try and make it work - would you be by my side if i get sick again ? ""**

**She said**

**"" No ""**

**That was it ... 0 reaction ... just No - Before this she would say things like**

**"" We will get through this "" - "" I'm here for you "" - "" Like you always say take it day by day ""**

I understand chronic illness is difficult for everyone not just the sufferer, i saw the effect it had on her and tried to help as much as possible ... reassuring i was doing everything i could .. showing her the real improvement. Things were getting back to normal for us.

I adore her completely .. she was the woman i was going to spend my life with.

Maybe i am naive - Maybe i just couldnt see how much it was getting to her. If thats the case and she ever reads this ... I'm so sorry i couldn't see.

Maybe she truly felt that way and the mushrooms just unblocked her walls .. All i know is she changed so quickly, she went from my partner to a Cold total stranger in a matter of days.

I will always be here friend ... no matter how far we drift she will always have support from me whenever she needs it ... i may have lost her as a partner but i never want to lose her as a friend.

I hope she finds happiness in life, truly i do ... i hope she finds what she couldnt find here.

**In 3 months she will move out and i am just sitting here shocked wondering wtf just happened**","And she saw you suffering and did zero caretaking? That’s wild to me. If she loved you, she’d want to help in some way. It really hurts right now but you deserve way way way better.",concur

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you. In Public chat there's a good chance others may jump in where you got lost,concur

I'm trying to hold onto the idea that there is no going back - as in ""two weeks ago we did XYZ and said XYZ and I felt XYZ way."" It's not like there were 2 versions of him. The version of him now (the one who broke up with me) *is* him. What I miss is the closeness and the trust. Feeling sad and working to not tell myself stories about that. Sad can just be sad.",concur
"I (25F) dated this guy (27M) for two years. I thought we were solid. We talked about moving in together. He even said he could see a future with me.

Then one day he ended things. No warning. Just said he didn’t feel the same anymore.

I tried to move on. Until a few weeks later I saw a post on his Instagram. He was with her. The girl he told me not to worry about. The “we’re just friends” girl who he used to hang out with all the time. She’d just gotten out of a long-term relationship.

The timeline lines up too perfectly. She became single… and suddenly I wasn’t enough.

What hurts the most is realizing I might have been the placeholder. That all those late-night talks, the little inside jokes, the things I thought made us us, they might’ve just been filler until she was available.

I haven’t told anyone in my life because I don’t want the pity. But god it hurts. It really, really hurts to feel like someone’s backup plan.",I dated someone for 4 years and realized way too late I was the placeholder.

"Happy to announce an exciting new project from the lab: “Adopting a human developmental visual diet yields robust, shape-based AI vision”. An exciting case where brain inspiration profoundly changed and improved deep neural network representations for computer vision.

Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168)

The idea: instead of high-fidelity training from the get-go (the de facto gold standard), we simulate the visual development from newborns to 25 years of age by synthesising decades of developmental vision research into an AI preprocessing pipeline (Developmental Visual Diet - DVD).

We then test the resulting DNNs across a range of conditions, each selected because they are challenging to AI:

1. shape-texture bias
2. recognising abstract shapes embedded in complex backgrounds
3. robustness to image perturbations
4. adversarial robustness.

We report a new SOTA on shape-bias (reaching human level), outperform AI foundation models in terms of abstract shape recognition, show better alignment with human behaviour upon image degradations, and improved robustness to adversarial noise - all with this one preprocessing trick.

This is observed across all conditions tested, and generalises across training datasets and multiple model architectures.

We are excited about this, because DVD may offers a resource-efficient path toward safer, perhaps more human-aligned AI vision. This work suggests that biology, neuroscience, and psychology have much to offer in guiding the next generation of artificial intelligence.

You'd need to do a lot of science to justify that comparison; the connection drawn in the paper is hand-wavy and based largely on innuendo. I also think the biological comparison is counterproductive. I think your preprocessing pipeline can be more accurately characterized in terms of the degree of a model's invariance or equivariance to changes in input resolution (in real space, frequency domain, and/or color space). Unlike the biological metaphor, which again is inappropriate and unsupported by evidence, thinking in terms of invariance to some set of transformations points towards a lot of obvious avenues for further investigation and connects this preprocessing strategy to a broader set of more general research.",concur

If they are at maintenance you will stay the same. When dieting your weekly calories is the most important. Some days you will go over your deficit some days you will come under.

"Hi..thank you for your help the other day 
Got my 83 yr old mum's CT scan back and on Friday was told she had MGI.

So we were pretty happy but I came to you for advice and in a nut shell you all warned that wasn't enough.

So I went back to the older person mental health team ( UK thing) and they said ""oh no now it's Alzheimer's, sorry we just looked properly and now we think this...sorry you now don't have time to come down to support your mum when we tell her""

So I thought we left it that the lady would say they needed to do more investigating and she would tell Mum that but skirt the A word while/until we came down 

Lady came round and told mum essentially that it was nothing to be worried about.

Now she says that's it . She will come round when we get there and tell her it's Alzheimer's ( which will obv be confusing for Mum as she thinks there's nothing wrong since the last visit)

But that's it .Have some Donepresil but you don't need to see the consultant...I know you have so much more in the US but doesn't this seem beyond slack?

"26F, NTRK rearranged spindle cell sarcoma of the endocervix. Stage 1b. I reached NED after surgery, and MD Anderson recommended no further treatment due to the NTRK rearrangement. Tumor was 15cm total and expanded my endocervix, never encroached into any other structure. My endocervix basically looked like the snake balloon that Shrek makes in the movie. The cancer microscopically aggressive — focal necrosis, 25/10 mitotic index, focally severe atypia. But, I achieved clear margins via a hysterectomy and had no LVI in either halves of the tumor (one grew like a polyp and fell out of my vagina which triggered the diagnosis, and the other was embedded in the connective tissue of my endocervix).

"For context, my ex and I have only been dated 3 months. I know. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a long time. 

He is 48, lives 1.5 hrs away, has 3 adult children, and widowed since 2020. I'm 34, with a 9 yr old. From since the beginning. I have made it known to him my views on sex. That it's not just intimacy for me, but a commitment. Without the legal part of it. In other words. Marriage. He agreed and has said he has always believed it to be the case also. He pursued me. He has always been the one to come to me for dates, went fishing,  taken us to cedar point as our driver so son and i can enjoy and drove 9 hrs that day. He has slept over 3 times and we never had sex of any form. Farthest we went were kissing. We have gotten so deep in our conversations about our faith, our life struggles, triumphs, fears, visions.. very early on, he has told me how much he loved his wife of 19 yrs. He has said, from the beginning, that he may never fall in love again. That the 2 relationships he had after his wife, he didn't think he loved. Just that he was sweet and kind to them..neither of these 2 met his kids or family. 1 he was with 1 yr, other was 6 months. He said he didn't have feelings for them. But for me, he did. He said I was different. That since he got back out to dating, he has had several first dates because they all were wrong for him. But even if he didn't say out right that he slept with them, I wouldn't be surprised. He has put a lot of efforts with me, given the distance. Spent on me, buying me stuff for my apartment, has helped me a little bit financially also.. courtship...more than just dating. More than that, he made me feel so seen. I have probably general relationship anxiety, or just generally anxiously attached. Of course I fell for him. I've had panic attacks and he had always been there to reassure me he wasn't going anywhere. He knows my history. I know he cared for me. 

I think at the back of mind, I had it all along the doubt planted in there that he may never love me. Therefore the anxiety. Had shown in plenty times, different ways.  In the beginning, he was reassuring, until I started feeling he's getting tired of it. I get it. I was single 4 yrs and celibate, because I knew I have this and its hard to live with this. He never told me he loved did. But has always said he had feelings for me.. I don't even know what that means. Please tell me.


Anyway, he broke up with me a week ago. The latest argument was that whenever he slept over, I noticed he never sat his phone down around me. When we went to cedar point, i can guess he had it on DND because when i called it to let him know where we we are at, it was off. He used it for gps in car and there was an announcement by siri that phone notification has been set for alerts for directions only. I just kept quiet.And even when he went to bed, it was in his pocket. I wasn't accusing i don't think, but I told him I was bothered by it. How it feels secretive. It took a while before I brought that up, he didn't like it. My fault also, I should have very early on. And maybe it was wrong timing because he has also been having financial crisis because of debt left by his Late wife.. Anyway, he broke up with me saying he cannot do al these emotionally right now because of everything going on with his life. That he hoped to be able to dive in and start feeling like he can love again, but hasn't gotten there and we are having all these issues already. That he cares so much about me and wouldn't want to hold me back from my happiness.. all I replied was ""I accept your decision"".. he then proceeded to text more asking if we could remain as friends because he wanted to keep me in his life. And I said, ""not right now""..then texted again that night we broke up, to assure me, he wasn't communicating with anyone else.  And I didn't reply.

Few days later, I texted him to let him know I was sorry for all my share in the demise of the relationship and that I cared about him. That he treated me with kindness, patience and trust..he did..and that when I can be totally at peace with the idea of never becoming more, I wanted to keep him in my life as my friend. We've never seen each other naked. So I figured, this man was good to me and it should be okay.

He texted back to let me know he wanted the same thing, that I was truly important to him and that I made him want to become a better Christian. That he wants to keep me in his life as a friend or eventually more.. and that he realized he needed healing.. and get back to his faith, so he can be free to love again.. and that when that happens...he will come find me..he wants us to remain close and keep in touch.. but part of me is scared. I didn't reply anymore. I don't what to think of that text. ","There is a lot here, so I may have missed it, but i hope you are doing some kind of work in your relationship anxiety. Did he give you any reason not to trust him? If not, than the thing with the phone is an overreach on your part. My phone is on DND a lot, especially if I’m on a date.

"Location: I'm in California, my mom died in Mexico and my Grandma died in Maryland. This is being managed in Maryland for reference. 

Basically my mom died when i was 16, I lived with my adoptive father (her husband) and my grandma died a month afterward. My mom only has 2 other siblings, her brother and sister, and they were my grandmas only family. Well my adoptive father sucked, he stole all my survivor benefits from me and kicked me to the streets. So from ages 16-21 I have been living paycheck to paycheck, didn't ever see university as a possibility, and had all but given up. 

Just yesterday, my uncle contacted me for the first time since I was 16 to tell me I've inherited everything my grandma was going to give to my mother... a little over 200k.

"Hi Reddit,

I'm new to Reddit and don't know if this is the right platform, so sorry if it isn't. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe to get it off my chest. Maybe because I still can’t breathe when I think about it. Maybe because I don’t know what else to do with the ache.

My (21F) boyfriend, Dillon, passed away in a car accident 4 months ago. Just writing that feels unreal. He was only 22. On his way home from work, a driver ran a red light and hit him from the driver's side. The doctors said it was instant. That he didn’t feel anything. I don’t know if that’s supposed to help, but it doesn’t.

We had been dating for almost 3 years. We lived in an apartment together. We had dreams. Someday we were going to live in a beautiful farm house in the country. He wanted 3 kids. I wanted 5. We laughed about how we’d compromise and get a couple of animals instead. We fought sometimes, like anyone else, but we always found our way to make it up to each other. He made the world feel like home.

He worked the night shifts at work (3:30pm to 1:30 am).  The day he passed, he kissed my forehead and gave me a hug. He said that he loved me and that he would be back. I said to be careful. He laughed ""always"". I heard the door close and that was the last sound of him.

I texted him at 1:32am, asking if he was on his way home. No reply. He should have arrived home by 2:10. He didn't. I figured that maybe he got distracted and started to talk with some co-workers. That happened sometimes. I tried calling him at 2:45am. Voicemail. 

I couldn't tell if something was wrong or if I was just being paranoid. 3:20 rolls around and I began to panic. He had never been this late before. I tried to blow up his phone with texts and calls, but I never got a reply. 

After that, it all happened so fast. I remember the phone call. His mom sobbing. My legs giving out. Screaming into the kitchen floor until my throat gave up. I got a knock on the door. I almost didn't answer. But I managed to get up from the floor. 

Two officers got a call from a neighbor. I broke down telling them what happened. They asked if there was anyone I could stay with for a while. I decided to call my mom to tell her what happened. She of course let me come home. 

Dillion's mom called his work, his dad is helping pay the rent on the apartment. My mom called my work and fed the cat and the dog. My dad was/is as unhelpful and narcissistic as normal. I try to be there as much as I could for Dillion's family. I don't really remember how I got through the funeral. I just remember the silence. The unbearable, bone-deep silence of him being gone.

I didn’t touch his stuff for months. I couldn’t. I would walk in to visit from time to time. His dirty clothes that I had always yelled at him to clean up, still smelled like him. His shoes and keys were gone, proof of him not being here. I would sit in his hoodie on the bathroom floor and cry until my head hurt. Grief is strange like that, it hits in waves, but some days it drowns you.

Last week his mom called me. She wondered if I needed help going through his things. Some to get rid of. Some just to… feel close to him again. We started a couple of days ago. 

Yesterday, I was cleaning out his nightstand when I found it. A small navy blue box, hidden under a book.  I opened it, and it took me a full minute to process what I was looking at.

An engagement ring. Simple, classic, and so pretty. I fell to the floor and sobbed like the day he died. He was going to propose. He wanted to marry me. He was going to ask me to spend forever with him. And he didn’t get the chance.

All this time, I thought we were just coasting. Waiting. I’d wondered if he’d ever ask. I never wanted to pressure him too much. And all along, he had a ring. He had a plan. He had a forever in mind, with me.

I held it in my shaking hands and the world stopped. For a second, I could see him smiling, nervous, down on one knee. I could hear his voice asking the question I’ve dreamed about more times than I ever admitted.

I would have said Yes. A thousand times, yes.
I would’ve cried. He would’ve laughed. And I would’ve said yes before he even finished asking. I would’ve married him. I would’ve grown old with him. I would’ve built a life, a family, a forever with him. 

Why did fate have to steal him from me? I will never know. But I will always know what could have been. If you've made it this far, please know that you should never wait for the perfect moment.

"Just wanna start this off by saying: 

I know i should break this off. I just don’t know HOW. 

So after being emotionally toyed with by my EX BF (22m), I ended up making cheating on my THEN BF (23m) and that costed me my relationship with him. 

I was very upset with myself so I decided to buy a train ticket to my hometown where my best friends live. 

In the past they both expressed their shared romantic feelings for me. Id be lying if i said i didn’t feel the same. We have been friends since highschool and they’ve gotten me through so much. I really have no idea who I would be without them. 

(This was about 5 or 6 days after me and my then bf split up) 
So when I got home and visited them we got drunk and had a threesome. It felt great to be embraced in this sort of intimacy. The next morning my friends asked me if I wanted to be their girlfriend (essentially a third) 

I didnt think much and I just said yes. I think I even said “fuck it sure”. A few days go by and they told me they would rather me not see other people and I complied.

I definitely don’t want to hurt them but I really just don’t think im mentally prepared for s relationship right now let alone a closed poly throuple. 

I have an incredibly low self esteem, i am overthinking things, losing my patience, and im constantly falling into depressive episodes. 

I know this can’t continue but they’ve really committed to this arrangement. They even bought train tickets to come see me in Brooklyn next month. 

My therapist told me that it might be more destructive to hide these feelings for an extended period of time. And i definitely agree with that sentiment. I don’t even know if Im cut out for polyamory as a whole.

 I genuinely just want to be alone for a bit and process my feelings regarding the various things ive gone through.

So with this my question is:

Do I wait until the visit is over or do I come clean in the next few days?

"I wanted to follow up on my previous post about my experience with Methylene blue (MB):

I am definitely convinced MB has provided the greatest improvement in the 4  years I have had long covid. I would say now that I have moved up to 8 out 10, I still have some symptoms but greatly reduced.

A couple of weeks ago I thought maybe improved sleep helped, perhaps it has added to the improvement or maybe its just some kind of arbitrary remission, I mean who knows with long covid but in the last week I am convinced it is  MB is helping me.

I worked on improving my sleep first, i had this crazy go to sleep at 11pm and then wake up every 2-3 hrs until 10 am and still didnt feel great. Dr prescribed zopiclone and I was on it for 6 months and it was useless except if i stopped taking it I had worse insomnia, I decided to quit and it took a week to get back to long covid erratic sleep. I ended up trying melatonin which helped for a while and then I tried Valarian. It has helped the most, it feels like melatonin helped straighten out my sleep cycle and valarian helps me sleep. I take 1.5 ml of a tincture. I think due to MB there are some nights I am not tired until midnight.

On to MB,

I have been holding steady taking 2-3 drops not every day, if I feel as good as I did the day before then I skip taking it that day. If I take 2 one day and 3 the next then I feel slightly jittery with no real difference.

Its been about 5-6 weeks now and the results have remained steady. Due to circumstances I wasnt able to take MB for 5 days and I definately regressed, when I resumed MB I  bounced right back the same day so to me this was proof MB is specifically helping me.

A few more observations:

\- I didnt mention in my last post that I was very sensitve to heat, many days last summer the second I stepped out into the sun it felt like it was burning me, there were a few times when I had to go out for a few minutes I felt wiped out and had to lie down. But last weekend I spent an hour in directl sunlight, it was a 100 degrees (30 degrees f) slaving over a BBQ for my church BBQ and it felt great, I was sweating like crazy but it felt good to sweat. I worked 6hrs straight on this BBQ and was really tired but bounced back the next day after a good nights sleep.

Twice in the past week I walked several KMs (1 mile) I was sore, muscle sore due to being a sedentary old man rather than body aches from long covid. I feel great 

My brain fog is not perfectly lifted but it feels like every day my executive brain function is back. I was able to hatch an elaborate daily plan to further my caeer plus exercise. I made a promise to myself that if I ever got better I would learn to run (I ran 10k 15 years ago) and get back to skiing next winter. ( I used to be a great skier)   I do notice I am not always on my game but I also have a list of easier tasks to do so I am always moving forward and productive.

I think that covers it, I probably wont post again unless I regress or something else drastic happens.",Thanks for sharing your story! Did you consult with a doctor at all with this?

"On an airport bus, I was taking a second to put my bag on a luggage rack, as my husband was making his way to the window seat so I can sit on the aisle seat beside him. I suddenly felt a nudge and a push - and I turned to see a woman push past me to another empty pair of seats. I said, hey no need to push, I was done anyway. And by now I am in fact completely out of the way. She says I have to be first, I am in a hurry. I said we're all going to the same place - the plane! Please use your words and not your hands to make way. She scoffs and says yeah yeah go back to the land you came from. I said this is my land, and I am a Dutch citizen. She said congratulations with sarcasm. Then I stayed quiet,

These words 'go back...'  stung soooo much, like irrational level. Maybe because it made me feel less than, in the tone that she used. Maybe it made me feel that she thinks she is justified in pushing me because I'm not the same skin color as her. 

Anyway the irony is she wasn't even Dutch (could see her passport a little in her hand, and it wasn't Dutch). But she just assumed that because she is white and I am brown she can say these words and they will hold meaning.

I just wanted to vent this out somewhere because it's a rather small incident, but because it's the only I've been involved in, I felt bad about it.",People can be awful sometimes. I’m sorry you had to deal with that.,concur
"After a first date, or early-stage date,  is there anything you do straight afterwards?  Think I could do with some ways to come down from the energy of the date, whether good or bad, calm and centre myself, and then reflect on my feelings and impressions of them. Looking for some ideas. 

Thinking about it, maybe I also need to stay more calm and centred during the date itself... Seems very tricky though. ",Fart for like fifteen minutes straight.,concur
"TLDR: Rant about how distressing it is to go from healthy to bedbound/disabled in 1 month with no clear solution or timeline to healing.



On June 4 I got 1 night of stuffy nose, high fever, and chills followed by an extremely painful sore throat for 4 days. I thought it was the flu, or just a cold, I didn't even consider COVID nor test for anything. When those symptoms stopped, I slept 12+ hours a day but just chalked it up to being my usual laziness/depression. So I decided to go on a hike to ""kickstart my body with exercise!"" (what an absolutely ableist idea!!), during which the brain fog was so severe and I was so breathless, but I pushed through. 2 days later I crashed so hard, experienced 2 bouts of horrifying tachycardia (I thought I was dying). I also noticed I had histamine intolerance symptoms after eating soy. I started on a Long COVID research rabbit hole and convinced myself I had CFS because the crash seemed like PEM. This was the start of being housebound.

  
Then I underwent multiple major stressors which made the fatigue and insomnia worse, to the point I could not get out of bed unassisted. For the insomnia and panic, I was prescribed multiple different benzos, which I used for 3-4 weeks, but now I think I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I've bought all sorts of supplements which I've found through this Reddit and the TREATME study, I use them with the fear I'll react negatively, or it'll make me worse. I went to the ER and from the tests they ran, there's nothing wrong with me that stands out.

My body is so heavy, even when lying down. My sinuses seem to be permanently inflamed. At least my brain works, but it's difficult to focus for long periods of time. My heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure have lost all rhyme or reason. My brain doesn't shut down to sleep, and when I wake up it's always from some twisted dream. I feel like I'm no longer a human being but just an experiment. Trying acupuncture, trying Chinese medicinal herbs, trying this or that. I pin my hopes on (another) Stellate Ganglion Block, or that right now it's mostly benzo withdrawal and it will ease in 6 weeks. I ruminate too much, which makes me suffer more.

  
My mind is just filled with medical anxiety, fear that this is the start of chronic illness, fear that my body is permanently ruined. That no medicine nor doctor can help me. I've already lost 10% of my body weight which is entirely basic function muscle. (I was only 52kg/114 pounds to begin with)

  
I try to see the positives. I'm not so lifeless that I can't get out of bed anymore. I live somewhere with a perfect climate and next to nature so I can lay outside and watch the birds and butterflies. I haven't experienced a crash from my new, slightly improved activity levels, so no CFS (yet) haha!!

  
The only thing that is 80% guaranteed to heal me is time, but the time does not easily pass when I have no long-lasting reasons to be happy, when I'm hot most of the time, uncomfortable 98% of the time, when I can't even nap to escape the situation. Even simple online games I loved playing don't feel satisfying anymore. Staying sane is an active effort.

I can't imagine the strength of everyone here who's been fighting with this for months, years. I don't even qualify for the 3+ month definition for Long COVID yet. I hope I recover so I don't have to. And if I don't, I hope to become strong.",https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Clinical-Care-Guide-First-Edition-2025.pdf?utm_source=website&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=clinical_guide_2025,concur
"I (25F) dated this guy (27M) for two years. I thought we were solid. We talked about moving in together. He even said he could see a future with me.

Then one day he ended things. No warning. Just said he didn’t feel the same anymore.

I tried to move on. Until a few weeks later I saw a post on his Instagram. He was with her. The girl he told me not to worry about. The “we’re just friends” girl who he used to hang out with all the time. She’d just gotten out of a long-term relationship.

The timeline lines up too perfectly. She became single… and suddenly I wasn’t enough.

What hurts the most is realizing I might have been the placeholder. That all those late-night talks, the little inside jokes, the things I thought made us us, they might’ve just been filler until she was available.

I haven’t told anyone in my life because I don’t want the pity. But god it hurts. It really, really hurts to feel like someone’s backup plan.","Yeah there's a lot of guys around who are just stringing their girl along until the one they really want comes along (or becomes available).

"I am writing this to just share what I have still in my heart. 

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down. Anyways, I was a fighter and got to know that it has higher chances of survival so I fought and finally I won Cancer in Dec if 2018 itself. Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it. 

So, now while I have recovered and doing all well, It broke me. My mind is not as sharp as it was. I am always angry, frustrated, mean and need support for decisions. It broke me! I am not what I was earlier and may never be.

"My car finally gave out. It had over 240k miles and needed a lot of work. I lost my job a few weeks ago and can’t get unemployment because that ran out back in February and obviously I can’t afford another car. I found a job in my small college town that I’ll start next week. I’m just not sure how I’ll get there or back but I’ll be making $30 hour working around 20 hours a week (I’m disabled, seeing an oncologist, and can barely handle that many hours but don’t have a choice) so maybe I can pay uber there and back? The job is about 10 minutes from home, I’m also actually considering an e-bike if anyone has experience with that. We have a bus in town that’s free as well thanks to the uni. I’ve just never not had a car as an adult and I support myself, husband and 7 year old. I’m waiting on 7f SSI to get approved which will hopefully be soon and maybe with backpay I can get a car.

"hi guys so i got diagnosed with adhd after graduating high school. in high school i was a straight a student but i just recently finished my first year of college and barely passed my classes. i even failed a class (differential equations tbf). i feel like i’m doing everything right to set myself up to succeed but i never get where i want to be.

 i also should add i went to a rural small town high school where i didn’t have access to a lot of the resources my peers had at other high schools. i go to ucla and as you can imagine that transition was super hard for me not having as strong of a foundation as other people in my major did. 

i constantly scored below the curve and only scored above the curve on a test twice (in calc). i am horrible at the tests. i may feel like i know the material and then get a 40% on it. i did over 60 pages of practice problems to prepare for a physics test and still failed it. i feel like i’m never truly prepared for the tests i take and sometimes my mind just goes blank.

 i just recently got testing accommodations but didn’t have the chance to use them this past year. i feel like i’ve tried everything and it’s just super unmotivating to study more than my peers and score below them. even worse it will be much higher stakes this next quarter as i am on academic probation so i have to improve my grades. do you guys have any advice for my situation?

edit: my current studying habits involve writing down the things i need to do for each day of the week and listing them by priority. what i don’t understand is at the top. i watch videos on the topics im confused on until i feel more confident and then do practice problems over and over and over lol. i also try to start studying 1 or 2 weeks in advance for tests but that’s not always possible. i’m also prescribed ritalin which i try to avoid taking unless i absolutely need it","meds help a lot with structure, focus, retention, as well as burn out. you’re allowed to use medication for a disorder that impacts your life and you dont gain anything by not using them. adhd impacts self control and you cant discipline a disordered brain without some help. - the second class finishes stay in your seat and re-read your notes. if i didnt do this those notes wouldnt be seen till end of semester. - typical for uni is practice tests and classroom tests are easier that tests. dont ask me why, it was the bane of my existence in uni. look online for more complex questions. - join a study group or find someone to study with! will help you study and other students can be a valuable source of information. - dont give too much information about your adhd or struggles, college is competitive and a lot of people feign concern or empathy. - post anonymously on forums for students with adhd, especially more related to your major. you will get better tips. see if your university offers bridging courses for students like you, or take courses online during the summer to strengthen your foundation. cut yourself some slack. adhd is hard and engineering is hard. adhd may cause some struggles, theyre unrelated to you or your self control/discipline.

"For background, my family has an endless history with Alzheimers/dementia. I watched my grandmother, grandfather, and 2 aunts pass from it. My mom is the remaining person in her immediate family alive, 70 years old. She has 2 APOE4 genes and as she has aged I've obviously been watching for signs, I think I'm watching it unfold and I need some advice.

She's been battling cancer for about 3 years, initially pancreatic cancer, which was caught early enough to go through a tumor removal surgery (whipple, very difficult). She also did rounds of chemo and radiation. Through this battle, she had times where stomach bile backed up into her brain and made her memory bad, we thought this would clear up once the bile could pass through her system after tumor removal. She also had very bad case of hospital delirium after surgery. Chemo ALSO added to the memory impairment. I've been waiting for a long time now to see if it was the cancer, surgery or chemo impacting her short term memory and if it would improve. It did a little but her memory has continued to be an issue. She did have a brain MRI in Sept. 2024 to check for cancer, not sure if this is a good baseline or if they would have seen something then?

She recently went through a traumatic break up with her partner of 15 years in the last few weeks and she has declined extremely fast. 2 weeks ago, we could carry on a conversation pretty well, now there is a lot of agitation and defensiveness, this is the most concerning part. I feel a little ridiculous looking back and I think I kept blaming all the cancer effects. She's now alone at her home, I'm scrambling to put together the reality of her state. Her home is covered in sticky notes, she has all these ""systems"" she is attempting to use. Myself, her friends and her neighbors nearby are all using terms like, she's having a good/bad day, to check in everyday. She told me the other day she's having a good day because she knows where her bedroom is, but then the next day, she can kinda keep the facade up. 

I reached out to her GP asking for support and advice, not sure what to do next. ","Thank you so much. I do have POA, got that set up during the cancer diagnosis.",concur

"My wife and I are in a really bad place, and it's 100% my fault. I'm looking for advice on how to move forward and rebuild the trust I've shattered.

About 6 months ago, a long-time female friend's washing machine broke, and she asked if she could do her laundry at our place. It felt a bit awkward to me, but I agreed. The stupid part is, I never told my wife about it.

This week, we were at a birthday party, and the friend casually mentioned it to my wife, thanking us for the help. My wife had no idea what she was talking about. The look on her face was a mix of confusion and humiliation. I feel sick just thinking about it.

The reason this is a catastrophe is that there's a history. About 5 years ago (when we were still dating), I went on a one-day trip with this same friend. I also didn't tell my wife, and she found out in a similarly unfortunate way.

So when the laundry situation came up, I was a coward. I was so scared of her reaction because of the past incident that I chose to hide it.

To be absolutely clear, there has never, ever been anything romantic or physical between me and this friend. She is genuinely just a friend. But I know how this looks.

I feel like the lowest person on earth. My primary concern isn't that I'm in ""trouble"" - it's that I publicly humiliated my wife and destroyed the trust I've worked so hard to build.

What concrete actions can I take to prove that I'm serious about changing? How can I help her feel safe and secure again? How do I address her (completely justified) new fears without sounding like I'm just trying to manage her?

"Some basic facts that people might find helpful:

* My father is 79 with Alzheimer's. His wife is around my age (50's) so she still works full time.
* I've been trying to get them to accept in-home assistance for a while, but his wife has resisted.
* He just had an incident that hospitalized him for a few days which finally got the ball rolling on in-home care discussions because it 'scared her straight', so to speak. We do have someone coming to go over our options in that regard.
* But in the meantime, she needed to go back to work upon his release from the hospital, so I said I would come help. Initially we thought 2 days a week would be good, Tues & Thur type arrangement. In the past, my father would insist on giving me $40 “for gas” any time I helped him with an errand, which was really gas plus a little extra for my time. When we thought it would be 2 days a week, I said “just gas money” would be fine, meaning $80 for the two days; she offered $100 and we agreed.
* However, once my father was fully evaluated during the hospitalization, we realized he can't be left alone any days, he needs full supervision now. I said I will come every day/all day while she is at work “until we figure out something” - meaning once we learn more about visiting nurses, aides, what's covered by insurance or not, etc. **But we never discussed any other payment amount for an every-day scenario.**
* Now that he's home from the hospital, I've had time to decompress and do the math. I'm realizing this will be a 45-hour per week time commitment including my driving time of 2 hours per day and a 5 day work week.
* In the past I've been a terrible people-pleaser/doormat AND my father and his wife have both taken advantage of that, as they are very self-centered people. I'm just being factual. She will push my limits so I want to go into this feeling like there's a fair arrangement for myself too, for once.
* SO! I'm feeling like I need to create some boundaries here, but mainly I'm apprehensive about asking to be paid anything beyond gas. I feel okay saying I need gas money, which would be about $100 per week rounded up, because that's hard to argue. But how on earth do I go about asking for anything on top of that? I'm only recently learning things like 'self-care' and considering my own needs, etc., so this is new territory for me.
* I don't yet know if and how much would be covered by Medicare for an in-home aid, but I do know his wife would prefer me to do it rather than a stranger. And I know my father would agree. So this could be ongoing for the foreseeable future, and I don't want to get myself stuck in a long-term unfair situation by not setting up an arrangement right now, in the beginning.
* How do I go about figuring out how much to ask them to pay me? “Just gas” no longer seems fair with 45 hours a week including the 2 hour drive each day, but neither do I feel like asking for the 'going rate' is fair because he's my father.
* If it helps to know, money is very tight for me, I live on Social Security myself and struggle to make ends meet, and this will be hard for me physically as well. On the other hand, a little extra cash could make a big difference in whether I make ends meet each month, so it could be mutually beneficial.
* I just don't know how to ask and how much to ask for. I do think a flat weekly rate would be best, for simplicity. Any advice?? Does anyone have any formulas on how to come up with a 'family rate' that's fair for everyone??","2.5 years ago my dad asked me to step in and help with my stepmother after she got hurt lifting too heavy.

He agreed to pay my rent and wages instead of working. They both wanted me to be POA. Over time I realized she was declining cognitively, not taking meds, or paying bills. Then dad started to decline cognitively and had health issues no one was aware of. Long story short, I and my husband became their caretakers.

"I just can't keep living like this. When I was a kid, I dealt with so much bullshit, with poverty making it worse. I remember constantly starving, being kicked out of a home either because my parents couldn't afford rent or they just didn't want me around, staying without power constantly bc bills were unaffordable, having no pads and getting in trouble at school because of it, etc. I thought maybe I could make life better for myself once I'm older. Instead, it feels like the world just crumbled as soon as I turned 18.

COVID-19 happened as soon as I graduated from high school, and the prices just soared on everything. Entry-level jobs were so difficult to get—I signed up for almost every job position in my area more than once and was denied. Can't afford college at all, and a scholarship wouldn't help, like I need a grant, yet I'm not able to sign up for FAFSA independently until I'm 25 or 26, apparently (my parents refused to provide the info that would help me sign up). Credit is already shit because I have medical debt as soon as I turned 20, just because my state didn't expand Medicaid and took mine away without any warning.

Found a job, but had to quit because both my physical and mental health fell to the crapper and constantly interfered with my ability to work to the point it pissed off my boss and coworkers whenever I had to suddenly leave, take a break, call off work, etc. Yet, I can't afford to treat my issues because I'm uninsured and can't afford ACA insurance. Every non-profile health organization is so damn far away from where I live and I have no transportation or money for bus tickets. I'm in pain every single fucking day, intense pain nearly all over my body that won't stop, and sometimes makes it hard to walk straight. As for my mental health, I've been struggling with this for years because my parents refused to take me to see a psychiatrist or therapist, making me go years without a proper diagnosis, always having a mental battle, and leaving me struggling in almost everything I do. But, I can't afford to do anything about it as an adult either.

Still dealing with food insecurity too. Every month, I'm able to get a little bit of food because of food stamps paying so little for it, but once that runs out, I'm always starving until the next Food stamp payment. I've been very underweight since I was a kid and was never able to gain weight even to this day. It makes me feel so cold all the time, even in summer so I have to wear a hoodie almost 24/7. This was also the reason I had to quit because when I was working, standing for many hours straight made me feel very dizzy and my boss didn't want me to sit all the time. 

I also have about three chipped teeth that are yet to be seen by a dentist and gum disease, but obviously, I can't afford to get this taken care of. And the crazy thing is, there is literally no dental school in my city that will work with low-income patients (there are about two, but they only do dental work for those with braces and the other for dentures).

I've exhausted my options for everything, searched every nook and cranny for solutions and I'm just so tired. I refuse to live through this any longer, and I'm contemplating whether to let sepsis get me from my teeth or to end things early.

I dont fully understand the 'health' vs 'not losing weight', because health and weight are related. But leaving that aside for now. Expand your go-to recipes by learning new ones. Get a cookbook (rather than juat googling them) and commit to trying a different recipe once or twice per week as a start. Work your way through the book. Rate the recipes between yourselves and figure out which ones you like. My partner is Italian, and we have a lot of pasta. But because I am trying to lose weight we very rarely have creamy ones, because cream adds a LOT of calories through all the fat. But we still have a lot of tomato based sauces, or even simple recipes like pasta with beans and garlic, with kale, anchovies, and olives. Or just butternut squash and herbs. Add a touch of parmesan cheese it makes it all better! But there's tons of other Italian recipes too that aren't just pasta. Basically just open yourselves to new food experiences and see what's out there. Learn about how food works (I'd say watch Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat on Netflix as a start!). Learn about other cultures through food, or your own histories (what did your grandparents eat? Get recipes from that crazy old auntie of yours. Etc). I mean, the world is your oyster!

"What level of care does someone who has really variable good days and bad days? 

Good days are where they are coherent in conversation, sometimes self-aware about their confusion and can remember some past events, but may still have short-term memory loops and not be able to cognitively process any technology or schedules or even know the day or time. Bad days are where they are very confused incredibly repetitive, fixated and frustrated, make bad decisions to disregard social norms, and do erratic things like spend all their money on things they don’t need (10 pairs of pants) and “feel dizzy.”

We are in bc Canada and my mom has gone into hospital due to a fall. She had a couple falls the week before she went in and now doesn’t feel safe and can’t probably go back to her independent living building, but she is not on any list for subsidized care as her disease progression has had a steep decline in the last month… We guess the hospital wants her out (she’s been there almost two weeks, nothing seems medically wrong). So they won’t want to let her stay much longer, but they can’t safely discharge to her current level of care. They asked me about our ability to pay for private long term care but pricing it out is outrageous / month 🤑! Assisted care seems like too much freedom not enough support for her to be safe (falls and wandering)… she obviously will need long term care at some point but is now too soon? Should we refuse to discharge her until they find us a subsidized long term bed? Or is keeping her in the hospital too cruel to her dignity and last coherent days with some intermittent capacity ? I’m her primary care giver with a family and a teenager of my own. My dad died in at Xmas and he did everything for them which hid how bad things were. Since then we have moved her to an apartment, cleared their house of 47 years and got her a diagnosis. She just continues to progress faster than I can anticipate. I’m maxed already with so many decisions…","I’m also in BC. I would refuse to discharge her. She needs more care than you can provide her, which it sounds like the medical people agree with. I think it’s better for her dignity, too, since hopefully she won’t have to be moved extra times. I’m sorry. I had a friend (in BC) who went this route for her mom recently. It went well. Whatever route you take, I wish the best for both of you.",concur
"Edit 2: Reading the responses, I feel like I'm forced to choose between love and being financially responsible.

----------

Edit: Woke up to a bunch of comments and I responded to a lot of them. How are people dating with just a couple hundred left over each month? Especially when the man is expected to pay for the majority of dates?

Also with the women I've entered into a relationship with, the majority were expecting me to own my home, not rent.

-------------

For the women of Reddit, how important is it for the man you're dating to have his own home? I've been told by my friends and family members that one of the reasons I'm not making much dating progress is because I'm a 33 year old, East Asian (Canadian Born Chinese) male who currently lives at home with his mom. It seems that for the majority of the women I date, whether first dates or in a relationship with, the moment they hear this, they instantly lose interest. Or in the case of one of my past relationships, she said I needed to move out within 3 months of going official or she'd break up with me.

It's not that I don't want to move out. Nor am I your stereotypical guy living at home in his mom's basement. I contribute around the house and pay rent. But financially speaking, it's near impossible for me to move out. I take home over $4k/month and I still don't have sufficient down payment to buy a condo unless I borrow over $100k from my mom because I can get only about a $300k mortgage loan @ \~4%. For reference, a good 1+1 bedroom condo with parking costs about $530k in my city. After paying all expenses and the mortgage, I'd have about $500 left each month. If I rented, the amount left increases slightly to about $1,000 each month. With either option, I'd become financially stressed and would have a very difficult time saving. I'm not a fan of living with roommates either, especially since I'd be confined to my room when I have the house to myself right now. I'm fairly independent and short of taking women home for a night of fun, I can pretty much do whatever I want.
","I'm not a woman but a lot of women I dated won't date a man without his own place at our age, unless there are some exceptional circumstances (house sale complications through divorce etc) Doesn't have to be owned, renting is fine. Personally I'd save up to move out and buy your own place then maybe start seriously looking for a relationship. Sure you may find someone but you'll dramatically increase your chances by moving out",concur

I'm a 33F single but I'm still in contact with the 34M I met from hinge less than 2 months ago. We only met once, he is currently living in a remote area for work which is 10hrs away from me. 

SITUATION:
We're on the same page on long distance relationship  that we can't go into it because both of us just got out of it. 
We flirted before we first met but afterwards I told him that I would like to be friends with him because it felt like I would lose contact with after that day. The only way I thought to keep in touch with him is to ask him to be a friend. 
He agreed and after that we still talk like we used to but without the flirting. 

HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM:
At first, I don't feel anything but greedy not to let him go because of his genuine actions and behavior. 

Now I think I'm starting to feel something for him. I suddenly felt I miss him today and would like to see him. I don't know if this would just keep developing. 

DILEMMA:
He will in my location next next month for 4 months. We agreed to met if when he arrived my feelings for him developed. 

Should I confess knowing that there a chance he might reject me? or keep the relationship but slowly die inside. 
In summary my choices are instant death or  slow death + torture. 🥲 haha

FANTASY:
If he is wanted me also, I'll be in a ldr again for him and will try to visit him. 

****UPDATE****
He suddenly came to the city yesterday for a medical appointment. I picked him up in the airport and dropped him at his bros place. I was so happy to see him but since I posted this, I got attention from other men and weirdly got matches in hinge.

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for clarity, perspective, and hope from people who’ve been through this.

Someone I care about (not a partner, but an ex that I managed to stay friends with) is going through what feels like a collapse. He has borderline personality disorder and is struggling with addiction. He recently relapsed for the first time ever on ketamine and cocaine. Prior to this he was an alcoholic that went to rehab for that. After trying to support him through treatment over the past month only to have him want help but then leave treatment AMA, I put up some boundaries and stopped engaging. I also refused to give him back his dog that I told him I’d watch while he was in rehab. Today, he texted me sad hopeless things like: 
	
“The meds just mess me up. I’m in a unique situation where the best meds don’t work for me. There’s only one left and I cannot take it. 

“Maybe drinking instead of using drugs is a win. harm reduction is good enough.”

“I’m dying, slowly but surely.”

“I need you to hate me.”


At the same time, he’s been isolating, sending concerning messages, and pulling away from people who care. But he also arranged for his sober coach to call me recently, and that call was calm, even thoughtful. It felt like he wanted someone to understand. Like he still wants help, even if he doesn’t know how to ask for it anymore.

I’m not his partner or family, but I’ve been holding a lot: caring for his dog, fielding emotional crises, and now trying to protect myself from getting overwhelmed. I’ve also been in touch with his dad, who’s trying to support him from afar and engaging with a lawyer to discuss possible guardianship (he’s a trust fund kid with unlimited access to money which makes this addiction cycle worse).

I’m torn between:

- Not wanting to abandon him
- Not wanting to co-sign his decline
- Wondering if this spiral is actually part of the path to something better?

So I guess I’m asking:

- Is this kind of collapse common before recovery? Do people get worse before they finally say “enough”?
- What does the beginning of true recovery look like and how can you tell the difference from false starts?
- What’s the most helpful thing someone like me can do? I’m not his partner, not his therapist just someone who cares a lot.

This is painful, confusing, and exhausting. I want to do the right thing, not the codependent thing. I want to hold space without holding the burden. I want to believe that recovery is still possible but I don’t know what that hope should even look like right now. And I’m scared and sad for him :(

If you’ve supported someone through addiction or BPD or Bi-Polar Disorder and watched them find their way eventually… I would be so grateful to hear what that looked like.

Thanks for listening.

"Hello r/GetMotivated,

As I (21F) mentioned in the title, I cannot really grasp the concept of enjoying the process of achieving goals. I just achieve goals, no matter how I do it. If i really need it, and if the effort is worth the goal for me, I do it, or if it's not worth it, I don't. I have ADHD and autism (if it's important)

I'll give couple of examples below

1. I work as a software developer intern. I do my job to get the money and to validate my university year (it's a requirement). I couldn't care less about the enjoyment of what I'm doing, I just know that I have to do it so that I finish my year and get my monthly pay. I'm not happy with the pay, but this was the highest paid internship.

How can I even enjoy the process of working, when the only thing I wish for is money to then be able to do what I actually like? It's not like I dislike IT: I've liked it ever since I was a child, and I still do it as a hobby sometimes, but ugh... How do you enjoy if it's work? I doubt anyone would've enjoyed flipping burgers in McDonald's or something. It's just work

2. I like to play games, but as soon as they become challenging, I stop playing. It feels like a waste of time and effort to try to win a game that's too challenging. Winning too easy is not enjoyable too, but it feels much better than always losing while trying to do the impossible.

Like, I have no idea why do I hate losing so much.

3. I hate to walk. I'm in good health, but walking feels like such a waste of time. People always associate ""enjoying the process"" with walking, ""taking a stroll"", that it feels nice and so. I've broken my brain trying to understand what they meant, because for me walking is just the thing that gets me from point A to point B, nothing more. Maybe I'll see something interesting around, but I for sure would NEVER go out without a reason, just to take a walk. I always HAVE to have a reason to go out: go grocery shopping, go get that board game, go eat out, etc., or else I will feel like I'm spending the time I have left on this planet on something that doesn't make me feel good. I even taught myself to make wider steps at some point, so I would spend as less time en-route as possible

It feels like my brain is trying to maximise the dopamine from doing as little effort as possible. While it's only natural, it feels like it's extreme, compared to other people, even people with ADHD. Everything has to be optimised, or I'd hate it.

I'm on my second psychologist now, and it seems like they cannot help me to find the reason why I'm feeling like this, despite helping me immensely with other things. 

If I want something, I'll do effort to get it, if it's not too much effort and if I'll get more dopamine than negative emotions from the hard path of achieving the goal. I have no trouble doing boring and mundane things, I always do them. My house is not always clean, but is for sure clean when I'm determined to make it clean.

The reason why I want to understand what's really ""enjoying the process"" is because I'm starting to realise that I could enjoy my life more than I actually do, but I don't know how.

I've always been like this. I don't have TikTok or other video scrolling apps like that, I prefer reading long articles over watchign a video of someone explaining them, etc. I don't have a problem focusing on anything

Edit: forgot to mention that I have plenty of other hobbies besides programming that I sometimes do, not all the time. I rotate between them, and pick one if it feels enjoyable. No problem in enjoying the process there","Ill go against the grain here. If you hate taking walks now thats fine. Then why are you bothering talking to therapists? Thats just another form of exercise and you’ve already decided that you hate that. And latching on to a bunch of diagnosis seems like it’s adding a bunch of meaningless work to your life. Or maybe more seems like an attempt to give it meaning. Everybody is now neurodivergent so whats the point of calling it out. Unless its debilitating to the point of you can’t leave your house then toss your diagnosis in the garbage with all the rest of the stuff you don’t feel rewarded by. Pick the couple hobbies you like and wrap yourself up in them. If you just want to phone it in at work that’s cool, or try and find a job or project at work you can lean into but that’s not assured unless you make it so. Welcome to adulthood. You are not special. You get only the joy that you make. There are 7 billion of us also trying to figure it out. You can go get a god to worship if you want to try and convince yourself that you are the center of the universe, or you can stop trying to diagnose all the reasons you are not. But at then end of the day it’s just you inside your bones walking around. As you age you’ll start to adjust to the notion that no one really cares what you do. And little by little you will start to care what you do and if you are lucky find some meaning in the labor of it. FWIW, you are human. Driven by some evolutionary needs to survive. You eat, seek shelter, try and avoid pain; all the usual caveman things. Love intentionally expressed, is your singular opportunity as a human to rise above those things. To put someone else's need above your own. Or, in a way, to put your own need to love above your own need to just survive. Love is the act of choosing, despite the work, to give to something or someone. Love practiced is where the meaning comes from. The world wants us to think it some magic you receive, but quite the opposite. It rewards only in the act of giving. It is a practice, and yes it involves some sacrifice. I.e. Approaching yourself when you say “this is dumb I don’t want to do this!” and making a choice to do it as an act of love. Don’t like walking? Try making it an act of intentional love to yourself. Then express gratitude to yourself after. Or even better go find purpose in a true act of service to someone else. Your complaint as I read it was “I don’t find meaning in any of this!” My response is meaning is not free and it seems like you are expecting it to be. You have to practice and work at it if you want it. That practice can start with any one small deliberate thing. It is your intention that gives anything meaning.",concur
"What other issues do you find these AI systems helpful with? (There have been strong criticisms here from time to time against CHATGPT and other AIs but I have found them very, very helpful.)

Some of the areas that CHATGPT and CoPilot AI have helped me with are:

Diagnosing my own Alzheimer's condition.
Getting appropriate medication for it.
Physical problems related to it, including constipation. 
Sleep matters.
What to ask my physicians about it.   
How help people take medications more easily.

The prompts need to be very carefully constructed, and cross confirmation with other sources is always a good idea. But my biggest issue with it is that it persists in continuation or engagement responses, like after a clear description of where flamminator valves are used; ""Would you like me to provide an in depth description of how flamminator valves work?"" The currency and all social media, large language models included, is engagement. They profit from you being there, using your limited amount of time on this planet to help them. These continuation or engagement responses are intended to keep you on the system for as long as it can. I call it evil names when it does it to me but I've also learned to formulate my prompts with ""Don't add any of your stupid continuation crap at the end of your answer.""",concur

You will still have quality problems even if you hire internally and will need to invest time to correct and clean datasets. I often end up pushing the DS team to do small sets of labeling themselves as there is tons of value in seeing the data and problems with your models.

Fortunately the recurrence is localized and treatment is working and I should be in NED stage in 2 months after my surgery if everything goes as planned, but I can't seem to get over this thing mentally. I keep asking myself ""Why me?"". To have a recurrence this late for ewing is extremely rare and it had to happen at such a point in my life where I was genuinely happy with my life. I made plans to get married to my fiancee this year. We got engaged just 2 months before this happened. It took a lot out of me to get out of the first occurrence at 15.

I hate putting my family through all this again. I hate putting my partner through all this before our new life has even begun. She doesn't deserve this neither does my family. I worry that when I come out of this, I'm gonna be a different person to what my partner saw and fell in love with.

No problem in enjoying the process there","This sounds like you hate ""wasting time"". If your brain has labeled something a waste of time, you switch into a certain mode, and that's that. I would suggest possibly looking into reframing certain actions. For instance, taking a walk. No one takes a walk to ""waste time"", they take walks to achieve a certain thing: usually mental relaxation / peace. Some people love impossible challenges, spending hours and hours perfecting their skill for the small chance of succeeding. Some people think thats a waste of time. Neither is wrong, its just how each person views it. Technically we are all chasing rewards. But at the end of the day, there is not a perfectly efficient way to get there. So, finding things that you enjoy along the journey is equally, if not more important than the reward itself. Because if the reward sucks, then you at least enjoyed the journey. One thing I will say though, is that sometimes it's important to have an open mind when doing something you might otherwise find boring. Truly - not in the ""okay, guess I'll try it"" way - in the ""I am going to try this and going to see what i like about it"". If you go through the whole experience and find its not for you, then it's not for you. Thats totally fine.

Like it just become a habit after a while, starting with all of us peers smoking together in college to now me smoking even alone at times.

It wasn’t even about the nicotine after a point. It was about escaping. About avoiding the slightest swirl of anxiety or whatever was bubbling under the surface. The smoke break felt like a breather from life, but looking back… I wasn’t breathing at all. I was just looking for ways too sabotage and find a reason to smoke. That 5 minute felt nice, but after that i was back in the loop of spiralling.

I’m a few weeks clean now (not my first try, but this one’s feeling different, I really hope it stays this time eh), and here’s the weirdest part now when I get overwhelmed… I just sit with it or sometimes even an iced coffee does the same for me, i try to compensate the smoke with maybe a good food item or iced coffee, ik it sounds weird but smh works for me. ome days i just ignore and let go off that urge, that 5 minutes of urge.

Hi 

I’m in my early 20s and just graduated college. My dad is going through chemotherapy for lymphoma, and I’ve been trying my best to support him. But lately, I feel like he’s constantly lashing out at me over small things, like cleaning his glasses the “wrong” way or trying to sneak in some protein into his meals (which doctors recommended, but he refuses to eat).

He yells, gets angry, and acts distant. He lashes out at others too, but I seem to bear the brunt of it. I understand he’s in pain, scared, and probably feels powerless. I know the steroids can affect his mood. But I’m emotionally drained.

On top of this, I’m also trying to find a job and start my life and the stress is getting too much. I love him deeply, and I don’t want to resent him. But I’m tired. I feel like nothing I do is good enough, and I’m slowly breaking down.

How do I cope? How do other caregivers handle this kind of emotional whiplash while holding everything else together?
This isn't me trying to make it about me I am genuinely tired

"I truly want to know if I should reach out or apologize so I can improve and be better for her if I should but honestly want to try to be impartial here. I (28M) have been seeing my girlfriend (33F) for almost a year now, I haven't had any kids and she has two and is divorced.  I was raised by my grandpa and my mom, while my father was absent. As such, my grandpa was my dad. He recently (1 1/2 months ago) passed, and I have been spiraling ever since. Hence my inclination to post here, I don't feel like I'm my normal self so hard to see if I'm thinking wrong here. It feels like there's this massive hole in my life that I'm struggling to adapt to, it hurts so much. Anyways, my girlfriend and I recently had a fight where she acted really harshly and did several out of character things (name calling, cussing me out, pushing me, etc) over how I've been distant and not myself lately. She hasn't lost a parent and I told her about how my loss was impacting me and what it was like. She apologized truly and profusely and wanted me to know she was here for me. Because of her kids, she said she couldn't be there physically always when I needed her (which I totally understand), but would always be there if for me if I texted or called. Well the past few days I've thought of him a lot and felt low. I told her how I was feeling after both of us were off work the past 3 days. She would initially respond and tell me she was sorry and she could only imagine how hard it was. I would try to distract myself by asking how she was or telling her about my day. She then the past 2 nights would ignore my text until 1 am, where I would finally send a goodnight and she would respond and briefly say she was busy. Finally today I texted and told her that hurt me that I tried to reach out for support, and she didn't take it well. She told me I had no idea what it was like to be busy like her and have two kids on top of working and taking care of the household, and it makes her feel pressured that I have such high expectations of her. I agree I don't know what that's like, but I feel that a text takes 5 seconds, and she could at least let me know she's busy and she'll text when she's in a more free spot. She says I'm expecting too much and making her feel like she can't be herself or live her life. I truly accept I don't feel like myself right now and also don't know what it's like to have kids and manage a house hold.

"My girlfriend and I have had sex a handful of times and we were both each other’s firsts. The first time only lasted a few minutes mainly because of nerves but also she was feeling pain. We knew it’s normal to have some pain so we didn’t think much of it at first. 

The second time we tried, I could barely put it in even a little bit, and we made 2 attempts before she had to stop because it hurt so much. She cried because she didn’t know why and felt bad and embarrassed. We recently tried again with no success. We kept the foreplay up and we even attempted different positions. Again, we both know that it can hurt the first time and even the first few times , but from what I understand it’s not supposed to be unbearable. 

I told her she should talk to a doctor whenever she sees a gynecologist but her parents can apparently see her medical records and doesn’t want them to know she is having sex so she doesn’t want to ask even though she acknowledges that she should. She says she’ll only tell the doctor if they agree to keep it off record but they’re not going to do that.

I want her to be able to enjoy something she desperately wants to do. Next time we do it we’re going to attempt to use some lubricant, but I think it’s more than that so I don’t have much confidence in it. She has had reproductive problems before but no doctor will take her seriously. Anything you think could help us out? Thank you.","Idk where you are, but in the US, she has the right to restrict access to her medical records. She is an adult, and no one is allowed to see her information unless she gives express permission for them to see it. Do they have access to an online health program that let's them see it? If that is the case, then she should be able to let the office know that all of her records for the gynecologist should remain confidential and they should be able to keep them off of the online program. As for her physical issue, do you happen to know what part is hurting? Is she feeling pain in her vulva (the vaginal entrance)? Or is it deeper, like from bumping her cervix (opening to the uterus)? Are you exceptionally large, length or girth? It's hard to pinpoint potential causes without more details. Seeing a doctor is definitely going to be the best way to get to the bottom of what she is experiencing. It could be as simple as the timing in her menstrual cycle or your size, or it could be a more complicated medical issue that needs treatment. If she is feeling pain in her cervix, you could try a different time in her cycle. As it gets closer to the start of your period, the cervix gets lower, and it can be easier to bump into it and cause pain. The same can be true if you are longer than 6 inches. If the pain is at the opening, it could be that she has an exceptionally small opening, and the stretching is causing her pain since this is her first time(s) (or that you are larger than she can handle now). Please encourage her to see a doctor and let them know to keep it confidential.",concur

 I’m 35 F and my ex is 39M. We were together 6 years.

Randomly me and my ex reconnected because of an admin thing (shared bank account we never closed).

After texting admin stuff, he was super warm and friendly and also hinting at the fact he is single now (and “old”). I know getting back with your ex is seen as a bad thing but without getting into the details, I do believe we have a chance to make it work.

He asked me so many questions and kind of asked me if I wanted to hang out soon and he wanted to meet my dog. It feels like something is still there and texting him makes me genuinely miss his sense of humour and just him as a person. In our last message he left the ball in my court basically him saying I should let him know when I’m in the area (coz I travel for work) and we would do something/hang out.

I’m excited but also the last 12 months I’ve been really sick, gained a bunch of weight and I don’t feel my best. I’m getting back into the gym and I feel motivated to feel better but it’s like I want to wait a few months till I’m “feeling” healthy and confident etc to see him. Idk. I just don’t feel great rn and I want to see him when I’m feeling the best version of myself.

This sloth plushie was the last thing she was looking at, so I kept the link and was planning on buying it for her. But in the meantime, I crocheted a scarf for the regular plushie she already has and I put some calming essential oils on it. So then, I kept the link for years and never forgot about it. Then, when I finally had enough money, I bought the plushie and I asked my sister for her friend's favorite color. I got soft fluffy yarn in that color, then I crocheted a scarf for it. This plushie is weighted and has lavender in it too, and I put some lavender essential oil on the scarf to help. It hurt my hands to crochet it though, because I had to restart the project a few times and I'm not used to crocheting something that big. I also didn't see this when I bought it, but it said that it was baby blanket yarn. And I kept it in my room until my sister's friend came over again. And then, when I was finally able to give it to her, she was holding back tears of joy. And I told her all about the plushie, how it's microwavable, and can be put in the freezer too. And I suggested she check out the website for any other questions. And then, I also gave her a 3D printed baby wyvern, and she was happy and said that she was actually looking for something like that to put on her desk.

"I will preface this by saying my mom (66F) has no ""real"" teeth in her mouth except for 1 or 2, the rest are implants. She has been getting these oral surgeries due to genetic bone loss for about 15 years now.

At this point, everything is infected and the dentist says she will need all of them out. There is no point of keeping 1 or 2. I will also say we trust this dentist very much, he's done all of her surgeries and has been our family dentist for 30 years. He is also a professor and teaches at an ivy leage about implants, so I truly feel we are in the best hands.

But I am just nervous for the outcome. She has been through these surgeries before, but not with demenita. I would put her about stage 5, possibly early 6. She has my sister and I and caregivers to help aid during the recovery but I get overwhelmed with this stuff and I am just hoping to see if anyone has any advice. I have debated putting off the surgery until she is settled in assisted living (we are aiming for Sept/ Oct) because she will have assistance, but I'm not sure if that's the best idea either

TIA <3","My uncle was only stage 3 when he had to have two fingers amputated due to A bone infection. Not exactly the same but here's what we discovered- Being in the hospital makes the dementia much worse. He was worse for a week while recovering- disoriented, hallucinating, agitated. I expressed concern to the doc after a few days and he prescribed some meds to help and they definitely took the worst away. So maybe talk to her doc before hand to ask to have some meds ready to be filled if needed. Give the pain meds as consistently on schedule as you can- they can't always tell us when they're in pain and it worsens the dementia when they are. EDIT: you shouldn't let someone who had had the removed use a straw- thank you for letting me know ! Try and make it ""fun"" somehow. For example, ~~your mom will probably be on a liquid diet for a bit so get some fun/silly drinking bottles with straws and give her protein shakes/smoothies that way~~ get her some of her favorite ice creams and popsicles and let her have as many as she wants. We got my uncle one of those giant foam hands for his favorite sports team and he wore it over his cast/bandage to remind him not to use that hand but also make it less scary. Plan activities to distract her from the pain and confusion like movies she loves to watch, or puzzles, etc. But don't be surprised if she's not much up for it. Finally, at stage 6, there is a risk she will decline permanently in some regard. I'm not saying it WILL happen, but it's possible. Trauma/pain/illness can worse. The disease. But leaving her in pain any longer with a mouth of infection seems worse to me. When in doubt, ask her neurologist. ♥️",concur

"Feeling really defeated right now…

I was diagnosed 2 years ago at 28 and it changed my life. I finally had drive. I moved to a new city, started a new job making the most money I’ve ever made and everything has been smooth sailing. 

A few weeks ago, my doctor took me off vyvanse because my blood pressure is elevated. I’ve been struggling ever since. 

I haven’t worked out and have no motivation to. Then I feel bad because I haven’t worked out and that’s a huge part of my life/mental health. My work load is insane and I just don’t have any motivation. 

I’m currently on amlodipine and hydroclorithiazide, hoping that I have better results next month, but just feeling really defeated. 

Would genuinely rather have a shorter/higher quality life than feel like every day is a struggle…

"A friend of mine got out of a LTR back in October of 2024. After some time spent on getting back on track, she started dating again around March: since then, she's in a sort of situationship with a man (mid 30s as well as her). Me and her catch up like once a week, and she opens up a bit about how's it going with him. Now, the issue is that I worry about her, hence the post. I am aware of attachment theory because it comes from core wounds and beliefs mostly developed in early childhood, and I myself am in therapy to overcome many maladaptive coping mechanisms that led me to abandon the idea of dating for the forseeable future. 

This man my friend is dating is showing pretty strong avoidant tendencies and behaviors. In addition to the situationship itself, he showed difficulty in talking about labels (she described it as him having an anxiety attack), difficulty in opening up (it's ok to talk about how the day went but the question ""how did that make you feel"" gets dodged or deflected), troubles with intimacy (as in, he needs space right after sex, it happens occasionally and my friend is VERY good looking, so I doubt it's a physical attraction issue), no texting for some days after dates. 

Because I am aware of the word ""avoidant"", I mentioned this to my friend, maybe clumsily, as a way to introduce her to the concept. She did a bit of research and was surprised by how this fits the guy she's dating. Unfortunately, she's already attached, and, despite the warnings, she'd still like to see if the relationship progresses. She's highly independent, emotionally intelligent, has many many different hobbies, a good network of friendships, definitely not the type to vomit her emotions onto you. Yet she's also someone who values communication, who likes to talk about problems and emotions and tries to understand you. And I fear this is just a no go with someone with his level of avoidance, despite them wanting the same things in the future (marriage and kids). I am worried she's gonna get hurt sometime down the line. So, help a worried gal out, is anyone here in a successful, solid partnership with someone avoidant (not in therapy as far as I know)? I think I already know the answer and ultimately I am aware this is her life and her decision to make..I just don't want to see her going through another heartbreak.

TL;DR: is anyone in a successful, solid partnership with someone avoidant (not in therapy as far as I know)? Worried for a friend who'd like to try this out.","Avoidance starts being an issue once someone gets attached to another person. So, from my experience, someone with those tendencies can seem like the most emotionally adjusted, excited, regulated person in the beginning, but they become completely dysregulated once feelings get in the mix. In the beginning, they can be (to some extent) open about themselves, their issues, and they can be affectionate with words (giving compliments etc). But once they get attached, all of that becomes dangerous. Someone that isn't into you is often hot and cold from the beginning, but someone with attachment issues starts pushing you away once you get ""too close"". Also, attachment issues can be an explanation but not an excuse. If the other person starts suppressing their needs, not saying they're upset when their partner pulls away after sex for example, things can go south quickly. Also, if there is no accountability or no effort in changing these patterns (therapy), nothing will fundamentally change.",concur
"I am on birth control our primary method of contraception. I take the depo shot every 12 weeks. I usually get it delivered from the pharmacy because it’s easier for me. Ive been doing this for over 3 years. And yes, I know the concerns for being on it this long. My gyno is looking out for me. But the delivery has always come on time so I can get it injected at the doctor’s office. But this time, it didn’t. 

I am currently in a battle with the pharmacy, my insurance, and I think uber? My prescription was picked up but it’s been “out for delivery” for days. So I think a driver has it, but they are keeping it. It’s been 5 days now, I am late, no one wants to refund me. I might have to pay for a new vial myself. Also if it gets delivered, idk what conditions it was in. I don’t want to take the risk of the driver doing something to it. So I want a new vial. 

But anyways, I am late on my birth control and I told my partner we can have sex, but only with condoms. I even bought some. But he won’t use them. He says pulling out is fine and I can go over 12 weeks on the depo shot

I am not ok with that. We are both child free. I know he doesn’t want kids and he’d also be a bad dad. I think he’s letting his lust get in the way. I don’t want to take the risk. He knows I’d get an abortion if I was pregnant. But also I won’t have unprotected sex and risk getting pregnant and then abort. If I am not protected by my shot, I won’t have sex. 

He wants to trust himself with pullout instead of use condoms. I won’t have that? How can I get him to understand that I didn’t cause this and he cannot have sex with me without a condom?

It will be nice if we can possibly get him on meds to at least help a little with the STM loss.

Is a CAT scan, MRI or other test useful to check for other things or is that just a waste? ","I'm 76 year old male and was diagnosed this past January with Alzheimer's through the PrecivityADS2 test. This test is very accurate in detecting Alzheimer's. I had been experiencing Alzheimer's symptoms since 2019 but the neurologists overseeing my condition did not think I had this darned thing. My treatment for the next 4 years consisted of yearly assessment with MRI, PET scans, etc., but those where not conclusive. After I received Aricept medication I did extremely well, and I am still doing well today, especially with Namenda. Because of the great response I had to Aricept (which CoPilot AI said suggested that I had Alzheimer's), I repeatedly asked for testing. I paid for the PrecivityADS2 test myself, this costing $1,450 and the phlebotomist came to our home to get my blood. She was very kind and the blood withdrawal was painless. I paid out of pocket rather than wait until Medicare did because I wanted to know my status ASAP! (A very sweet person here (HG) said that she was able to get the test for a family member for $99. That's a terrific price, especially as it can diagnose the condition so accurately. I very strongly suggest you ask about this PrecivityADS2 test and also ask about Aricept medication for your SO, and possibly even before the diagnosis is confirmed. (CoPilot AI said that a positive response to Aricept suggested that one has this condition and I had a very positive response to it.) I had several MCI tests and they showed me to be in the impaired range, this suggesting dementia and consistent with Alzheimer's. (CHATGPT says that an estimated 60% to 80% of people diagnosed with dementia are later found to have Alzheimer’s disease as the underlying cause.) It took me 5 and 1/2 years before I got my diagnosis and I wish to heck I had learned it earlier, for planning purposes, etc. During those years I felt very helpless -- the lack of a diagnosis was not at all consoling to me. Also, had I been given Aricept earlier, I believe I could have continued longer in my job. At that point I had been working 35 years as a clinical psychologist evaluating children and families. I really enjoyed my job and thought I would continue working in the field until my 80's. If you have any questions about this, please do not hesitate to respond! My fingers are crossed for your session today! I wish the very, very best for you and yours!

"Hi guys, I need some legal advice on the caption basically. 

Location: California

For context:

My (25F) parents (both 55) have been farming for over 10 years now. Whenever they have unused farmland they like to share by letting their elderly friends (ages 50-70s) garden on our plot of farmland. It’s a very common hobby for those in my ethnic group, but one of them (whom I will just call grandma.) took a hard fall yesterday and to make sure she didn’t break anything we took her to the hospital. 

When the hospital staff asked for an emergency contact, I asked her for her daughter’s # so that I could put it down and also notify her of her mother’s injury. But grandma would stay silent or hesitate and when I repeated myself she refused saying her daughter will yell at her for getting hurt because they always scold her to not go farming because of her age (72). So I temporarily put down my phone number. 

Unfortunately, the fall caused a small fracture in her hip bone. After the visit, I took her home and was hoping to run into family (who I do not know) so I can pass on the medical advice that the Dr. told me to follow for her recovery but the daughter was not home.

I think her son-in-law was home, but grandma wouldn’t let me call out (I think he was in the master bedroom while we were in the doorway). Stating that she didn’t want to get in trouble with them, and to keep quiet. 

I did not want to disrespect her by just ignoring her and intruding into the home to find the son-in-law so I informed her on how to take her medication before leaving, reminding her to talk to her family because an injury is not something she should hide.

Now:

It’s the next day, and my mom gets a call from a # we don’t know. It’s the daughter. She was VERY MAD (I would be too if I was in her shoes honestly) asking why we did not call her (mind you, we don’t know her number and grandma refused to give it to us). I don’t know if it’s the anger speaking but she keeps accusing us of causing her mom’s fall and that we hid it on purpose. There is no direct translation of her words in english but the gist is that “I am not dumb, you guys did something to my mom. I will follow the law and trace things back to you.” 

And I mean, go ahead. We don’t have any guilt because we did what we could to help Grandma. But what I want to know is if she’d have a case against us because grandma did take the fall on our plot of land. We covered her medical costs already and don’t know what more we can do in this situation. 

What I want answered is:

1. Is it even illegal to not inform family of their love one’s injury if the injured person refuses to provide contact information?

2. Would she have a valid case?

TLDR: Mom’s elderly friend took a fall on our land, we took her to the hospital. The friend refused to give contact info to her loves ones because she did not want to get scolded. Now her loved ones are threatening to sue because we did not inform them of the injury making them suspicious that we did something to cause the fall when we didn’t.","As long as you are not a caretaker you don't have a legal obligation to inform them. Even then, still up to her. If they really want to, they can try to open up a case with adult protective services for abuse, however it doesn't sound like there's any reason to believe that occurred.",concur
"Location: Salem Oregon 

I had an ignition interlock device installed in my car. They told me that my battery needed to be replaced. I told them that I just bought the battery and that if there is an issue with a battery I need them to pull it out so I can take it to AutoZone to get it replaced. They said they would put it on their charger and see what happened. They ""discovered"" that it was not an issue with the battery. He told me it was probably the alternator. 

I am a mechanic in my own right. I took a multimeter and my alternator is output is 14 volts, which is appropriate. When I got my battery from AutoZone they had to replace it twice in one day because the one they replaced it with was not functioning. A + b equals there's probably a problem with my battery. 

My car would not start this morning so I used my father's jumper box to start the car. I called the mechanic who installed it and asked if using a jumper box or trickle charging would cause issues with my device. He said no it would be fine. I charge the battery, it ran fine. No problems whatsoever. Driving home from my parents house (It's a 2-hour drive) The device said okay to restart your car, which it only does when I turn the car off. I was actively driving down the freeway at 70 miles an hour and have a picture of it. 

I attached the jumper box that I got from my parents house to the car to see if that would turn on the IID. It did not. I noticed when they wired it they put them under the engine cover next to the engine. I thought maybe the plastic of the wires melted. No such luck, but what I did discover is that they cut into my wiring harness and cut a wire in my wiring harness. Every single thing that I see on the internet says that they should not have cut into my wiring harness or cut any physical wires in my car, as it can cause the car to have electric issues as well as think that it's being stolen. A wiring harness alone costs $1,000 not including installation. 

At this point I have not had a chance to talk to the shop regarding it due to the fact that they were closed when this occurred. I plan on speaking with him in the morning, but I'm not 100% sure I actually want to have it installed or have them touch the car again. (Pretty sure that's understandable) 

Do I need to do any of this communication in writing? I've already contacted the IID company about the fact that their mechanic cut wires in my car, and they said just to have the car towed to them and have them work on it.","I understand, but you just have to prove it wasn't like that before they installed that part or after they installed the part. Installing things into cars and repairing them, it's the same thing. That's just semantics. A lot of mechanics are part changers anyways, the main defining characteristic of one who is NOT is a detailed diagnostic report of why they recommend installing the part into your car. If you told them to install it, then there is usually no liability if it doesn't ""work"" since it wasn't fixing anything they said was wrong with it in the first place.",concur
"Hi everyone,

As part of my dissertation for my Computer Science degree at Newcastle University, I investigated how to enhance the current state of 3D print failure detection.

Current approaches such as Obico’s “Spaghetti Detective” utilise a vision based machine learning model, trained to only detect spaghetti related defects with a slow throughput on edge devices (<1fps on 2Gb Raspberry Pi 4b), making it not edge deployable, real-time or able to capture a wide plethora of defects. Whilst their model can be inferred locally, it’s expensive to run, using a lot of compute, typically inferred over their paid cloud service which introduces potential privacy concerns. 

My research led to the creation of a new vision-based ML model, focusing on edge deployability so that it could be deployed for free on cheap, local hardware. I used a modified architecture of ShuffleNetv2 backbone encoding images for a Prototypical Network to ensure it can run in real-time with minimal hardware requirements (averaging 15FPS on the same 2Gb Raspberry Pi, a >40x improvement over Obico’s model). My benchmarks also indicate enhanced precision with an averaged 2x improvement in precision and recall over Spaghetti Detective.

My model is completely free to use, open-source, private, deployable anywhere and outperforms current approaches. To utilise it I have created PrintGuard, an easily installable PyPi Python package providing a web interface for monitoring multiple different printers, receiving real-time defect notifications on mobile and desktop through web push notifications, and the ability to link printers through services like Octoprint for optional automatic print pausing or cancellation, requiring <1Gb of RAM to operate. A simple setup process also guides you through how to setup the application for local or external access, utilising free technologies like Cloudflare Tunnels and Ngrok reverse proxies for secure remote access for long prints you may not be at home for. 

Whilst feature rich, the package is currently in beta and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Please use the below links to find out more. Let's keep failure detection open-source, local and accessible for all!

Also I know you're just writing this because projects need to sound impressive, but 1 fps (or even 0.1 fps) is fine for a spaghetti detector, because it takes time for the spaghetti to be produced anyways. An extra second delay is perfectly adequate, as it takes humans much longer to fix the issue.",concur

Im currently paying $1,200/month for a child I never had in Los Angeles. Long story short I dated a girl in California for 4 years when I was 18-22 years old. She got pregnant and we didn't know whose child it was. Like the idiot I am, I stuck around to find out and fell back in love with her. Once I found out the child was NOT mine, I was already invested. 2 years later she cheated again and I left her. Now child support of Los Angeles is taking $1,200 a month from me.

What’s good for the person paying the child support doesn’t factor much into it. Once you accept responsibility for a child, it is extremely (if not outright impossible) to get out of it.

"19M, just finished high school and am planning to attend college within a year or two. My issue is that I have ZERO understanding of any financial concept and jargon necessary to live alone.

I live in NB, Canada, and had worked for about two years up until summer of last year. I was mostly working out of obligation, never saved, and let my parents set up my accounts for me (big mistake). My financial awareness went as deep as knowing my bank account PIN and email passwords, oblivious to what in the world tax returns, RRSP’s and SIN’s are (I still am).

Nowadays, relationship with parents are shaky,  almost broke, and taking a second gap year after missing the application deadline TWICE. I know I need to get it together but I’m hella overwhelmed by all the information being tossed over here.

First, I’m aware that I must have a SIN to legally work, yet I don’t know what it is or where to look to access it. I’m not exactly thrilled knowing that one of my most (un)trusted parents have that information either. Second, I’ve never filed a tax return IN MY LIFE and apparently that’s mandatory and now I’m screwed? Where do I even get the stuff for that dawg? Lastly, what do I have to do to have an RRSP? Is that automatic or something I set up on my own?

I make this post hoping I could get input from people with better knowledge and far more experience than me. I’m not trying to become a financial savant or looking for get-rich-quick schemes, I just want to learn as much as I can before setting off into the adult world.

If there’s something important I didn’t bring up and should know about, please feel free to add it to the responses.

"LOCATION: Las Vegas, NV

I have the owner of a small IT computer company that has been escalating the last few months after a bad interaction regarding my 70-year-old father with dementia. My dad made an appointment with him to “fix” his computer, which did not need to be fixed… I called the IT guy to explain to him the situation and his services would not be needed. He requested to speak to my father on the phone to confirm cancellation and the first appointment was canceled. A few weeks later while I was at work I got a notification saying my father was attempting to change passwords on the bank accounts. This IT tech came to our house while I was at work and assisted my father with changing his bank account passwords and then try to charge him $300 for $150 job that wasn’t needed to begin with. I ended up meeting up with them at the bank because supposedly he insisted to bring my father to the bank to “be a good guy and help him out.” Mind you I have papers that document that my father is not able to make medical and financial decisions for himself due to this cognitive decline. The living trust that is in place has me listed as POA.

He ended up not taking any of the money because he was scared of any legal action taken against him. The next morning, I filed a police report for documentation purposes and was advised to write a Google review about the occurrence. I wrote the Google review and explained everything that happened, all factual and no lies were told. A few weeks later I get a cease and desist from an attorney that is known to give out cease and desist letters that are so extraordinarily wrong that his Google reviews showed that he’s lost a few cases for the exact situation I was in, which is attempting to say what I said was defamation of character and slander. I was advised to ignore the cease and desist which I did.

Roughly 2 months later, the same IT tech shows up at my door, almost crying and gets on his knees with $1000 cash in a hand, offering it to me in exchange for deleting the review. I did not take the money, but I recorded the entire interaction. I told him to leave multiple time and he would not leave.

The next day I went to the same police station and filed prior police report explaining the unwanted interaction. This man has been escalating, and I have been afraid for my safety because I’m not sure how far he will go.

Based on the information given, am I possibly able to get a temporary protection order from him and a harassment charge?  I have the police reports, pictures of the Google review and his response to my review, the interaction at my door, the cease and desist paper/ email and a call log showing that I called him to cancel the first appointment due to the fact my dad is cognitively impaired.","Op just to clarify, a poa lets you do things on dad’s behalf.

"Hey guys, not sure if I’ve brought this up already but as you guys know, this thing comes with sleep issues of course. A thing I had before randomly was small periods of waking up at specific time at night but it went away months ago. However, for the past month I’ve been waking up 5 hours after I go to sleep. Every. Single. Night. No matter what I do before bed. No matter what time I go to sleep. I don’t wake up particularly anxious or super awakened, just really tired and ready to go back to sleep. I, looking into it, was thinking it was because I was going to sleep mostly at around 5am super late but I started sleeping earlier and earlier and it’s the same result. After I wake up, I go back to sleep sometimes and if I stay asleep, it’s 5 hours as well. About a month BEFORE this started, I had a sleep study because I was so fatigued after my sleep. And coincidentally my sleep got better afterwards, but now it’s this bs. 

Anyone have any advice or tips? Or similar experiences? Like always, thank you guys.","This started for me 6 months ago. I'm wide awake all night, fall asleep and only sleep for 4-5 hours.

My daughter Sarah is 16 and has always been a good kid. Straight A's, never in trouble, responsible. Or so I thought.

Yesterday I got a call from school saying she'd been absent for the past three days. When I asked her about it she said she'd been in class all week. I checked her attendance online and she's missed 23 days this semester. Twenty-three days! And I had no idea.

I went through her phone (I know, invasion of privacy, but I was desperate) and found out she's been spending her days at her boyfriend's house. This boy I've never met, never heard her mention. She's been lying to me every single morning, leaving for ""school"" and going straight to his place.

The worst part is how good she's been at covering it up. She comes home at normal times, talks about her day, even complains about homework. She's been forging parent signatures on absence notes. I feel like I don't know my own daughter anymore.

When I confronted her with the evidence she broke down crying and said she was ""sorry for disappointing me"" but wouldn't explain why she started skipping or who this boy is. She just keeps saying ""you wouldn't understand.""

"Like the title says, I am seeing advice on re-inventing myself. A little backstory, I (26M) was recently diagnosed with ADHD just last year, and up until that point I had only been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, and as a child I was diagnosed with ADD but only took medicine for a few months and my parents didn't really believe in the idea of mental illnesses. 

  
To keep things a bit short, throughout my childhood I masked the issues with what was very likely my ADHD, as well as hid personality traits to make other's like me. After many years of therapy, and working on myself, I finally feel ready to live as my true self. The catalyst for this was finally deciding not to force myself to have a relationship with my dad for the sake of making others happy. 

With that in mind, I have come to the realization that I don't really know who I am or who I even want to be. I am not happy with how I have been living my life and want to change and stop trying to do things that make other people happy. But, I don't know how to do this.

Well got a call after this week (Friday) PET\\CT lit up something on the lower rectum as well as some lymph nodes in the area, Just saw from an email from the insurance this morning that my Oncologist has requested an MRI, and when we spoke on the tele she said she will call my surgeon to set up a biopsy and submit my case to their conference or council meeting. I was hoping she would have released my Scan report so I could have information to work with... but I guess since I am meeting her Wednesday, she has decided to hold onto it... (I not a fan of that) so I am just feeling around in the dark looking for answers and hope.

**Question**

**My Question**. Would this situation be consider as something they / we have caught early or can you still have something like stage 3 or 4 even though you were under heavy cancer surveillance? I know PET sand CT scans can miss things... but could cancer be that stealthy that even after 3 or so years of scans and looking for cancer... this second cancer could have been growing and may end up being worst?

Or have we caught this thing early in your opinions. I so wish I had the scan report right now.. so I could see the numbers and read the impressions from the Dr Reviewing the scans.... As it stands now.. I have to wait to Wednesday and that bites.

Thank you in advance for any insight .

Update Just to help  others hopefully.

So oncology says at this point everything is in an unknown state. And because I have had cancer protocol ismto biopsy it , see the location, determine if this is my existing cancer that is reoccurring or if this is a new cancer.

The hope of course that this 2.3 cm thing is not on the sphincter... (fingers and everything else that can be crossed). Imwill seemthe surgeon in September and he will schedule the procedure where they look at you from inside out tomfind out where things are. Its like an endoscopy type procedure from my understanding. I need to research it.

The Oncologist said based on different factors, Radiation and chemotherapy alone could be an option,  If its new cancer the will treat it that way , if its something different they wil cut it out, and again location is important.

So lots of unknowns at this point but I feel better that I know more and Imcan begin my research in to my options and possibilities.

I will stop taking CO-q10 and I Will no long trial NAC. Too many conflicting write ups about it helping or hurting.

- Division that actually works reliably (finally!)

"Throw away cause my friends have my reddit and I really dont know what I would do if this all got out. Also I dont post much on my main, so if my formatting is trash, sorry.  So I've had this long time friend we will call Alex.  Alex is someone I met while working at a call center back in 2022, at a work club fair. For context, I hosted a club there for people to play smash bros at, that nobody really showed up for. Alex went to the club fair and actually played a game.  We've friends ever since. A few years later Alex came out to me as trans, acually a good while before she started transitioning.  She then moved with her mom to a different state but we kept in touch over discord.  I had started developing feelings for her, but never acted on them because I didn't want the friendship to become awkward and I was never certain as to what those feelings meant.  After some time I had meet a new friend on a dating, we will call her sam.  Sam Is someone that I hit it off with pretty quickly but, I had found out that she was in a bit of a messy break up that lead to some trama on her part so I alected to keep things platonic.  Which I still feel today that, this was the right call.  Shes a good friend, I just don't feel anything romantic towards her.  Long story short these 2 friends are now dating, and its giving me alot of conflicting feelings.  At the end of the day I want them both to be Happy, and Im glad they are.

"**Edit:** Putting this at the top. To explain my situation a bit better and maybe to put things another way, I think I'm having a hard time with dating again because currently I feel happy a lot of the time and am actually doing okay being single. But a big part of that is me putting a lot of energy into being intentional about how I take care of myself. I think dating other people will throw that energy off. I'm still navigating this and trying to find a healthier relationship with my approach to dating and being around other people.

\-

I've(40m) been trying to figure why I feel so blah about trying to date again. It's been a year since I was out there on the apps. I tried more speed-dating events recently and they've been okay, but even with getting matches I just felt kind of over it.

I'm sure part of this is feeling hurt or jaded from past dating. However, I've come to realize that these feelings of meh are because I've actually been afraid to lose my emotional freedom. Personally I've been in sort of a transition period over the last year. It's only been in this time-frame that I've found the well in the clearing where self-compassion, self-love and ability to self-sooth reside. Still working on that muscle. So when I say emotional freedom I mean the ability to pour into my cup and not others. My last big relationship and all the people I've dated since have been about me pouring too much energy into them, leading to co-dependency and losing myself in the process. Yes, dating is emotionally exhausting, but I see that that's partly of my own doing.

Something else that's new for me is a sense of self-agency. I'm still trying process that and a lot of other things, but these feelings of self-agency have felt absent for my entire life. Which explains not being able to drive where I'm investing my emotional energy.

So the question I have for others is how much self-agency do you feel you have in a relationship? How much is healthy? I have to be honest, it's still making me uncomfortable thinking about showing love and kindness to myself while in a relationship as I'm afraid it will take away from a need I have to invest in the other person. I guess I'm partly looking for re-assurance that one should maintain some autonomy in a relationship and that it's okay to pour into your own cup. Yes, it sounds crazy to me to be writing that too. But I am still coming to terms with it and trying to see what it looks like in a relationship.

This post might also help others. Definitely encourage you to think about where you actually are with these things personally.

Also, I really appreciate everyones in-depth response to my last post.",">So the question I have for others is how much self-agency do you feel you have in a relationship? Lots. I still have my hobbies, some might overlap with my partner but they don't have to, we can each have our own things. I still have my friends, and I will meet them with or without my partner. We would enjoy travelling together, but solo trips are also fine. I don't have to ask for permission to do things, I ask for their thoughts out of interest and have discussions as a team where relevant, but ultimately we are two independent people who can still make decisions for ourselves while staying together. We can say ""No"" to each other and it's ok. There are plenty enough times we say ""Yes"". We might still make joint purchases but don't combine finances as it doesn't seem necessary due to being child-free. We can spend on what we want individually and don't have to consult each other, though we may ask for opinions.",concur
"I've been out of the dating game for 3+ years due to a health issue. I'd like to get back soon. Before that, I was almost exclusively trying to meet women through the apps. I definitely struggle with viewing women as wanting to be left alone almost all of the time in every scenario. I consider myself a socially-adjusted guy, I have plenty of friends, hobbies, a home, I'm well-groomed and in decent shape... not bragging about this, just giving a baseline so everyone's aware I'm not an isolated weirdo wearing unwashed sweatpants and an Anime t-shirt, living at home with mom.

But every time I'm out and see someone I'm attracted to, I can't push myself to go say hi. And I'm not talking walking up to someone on the street on the way to work, but even in shared, relaxed situations, like a concert, bar, or park. It's especially bad if it's in a male-dominated event like a comic-con or a sporting event, because I assume I'll just be guy #108 ruining their time out.

What's eating at me today is that I was playing Pokemon Go in the park this morning with a bunch of people for an event. A woman just my type, appropriate age range, also there by herself with her dog, was hanging out and playing. To make a long story short, looking for one in-game thing, we ended up reasonably by ourselves in a nice shaded area, just hanging out. For at least half an hour.

I didn't say a damn word to her. We had a shared hobby, I could have asked to pet her dog, asked her if she was having any luck catching Pokemon, anything. I just froze and concentrated on the game, and even when she walked off to catch a Pokemon I was about to walk to, I sat there and waited because I worried she'd think I was following her. And I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable just enjoying her hobby and fresh air.

I just froze because I didn't want to ruin her day. I guess my question here is... was that an appropriate place to get to chatting with her? Would I have ruined her day or scared her as a single woman in the park? Should I have talked to her? What should I have said?

I used to be decent with women in my teens and 20s but I've definitely gotten more worried about how they're going to feel, and the apps feel so much safer because I already know there's some mutual interest. Thanks in advance for any advice.","My guess is you might be too concerned about romantic outcome of your interaction that subconsciously your brain is running at 175 mph trying to analyze everything around you to make sure the interaction is perfect, as a result you just get overwhelmed with fear of saying or doing something wrong. I've been there quite a few times, that's why I'm an introvert, and even to this day I'm unlikely to strike up a conversation with anyone unless they start it with me first lol. Maybe for a second just view them as another friendly human being and just try to talk to them like you'd talk with your buddy, or your relatives. Remove the idea of romantic connection and view them as a friendly person first. Take a deep breathe, and start with ""hi"" and then just talk about what you wanna talk. See how the convo is going, and progress from there. We get so concentrated on the outcome we desire (the summit of a mountain = potential romantic connection) that we forget there is still a mountain to climb (initial normal friendly interaction). Stay calm, be you and try just a friendly conversation. Good luck!",concur

"It's a very long story, which I won't bore you with, but our neighbor has been stirring up trouble for us, more intensely the last two-three weeks. Late last night, she and her friend let loose a couple of screeds in my messenger  and text bbox. 

I know some of what she said is true. But I have spent the last decades of my life taken care of my parents. Dad passed in late 2019, and it's been Mom and I ever since. She currently has neuropathy and lymphoma and is beginning with very light dementia.  I am responsible for pretty much everything. We do live in  poverty or close to it; I've never checked. 

Despite what our neighbor said, I/we have tried to fix what she's complaining about. Last year we were scammed out of $7k+, for example, trying to do just that, for the umpteenth time.  I have begged and pleaded multiple people multiple times for help with cleaning, both here and my grandparents old house, bought by Mom & Dad from Grandpa before he passed. No every time. 

We should be hearing from the scheduler at the hospital soon for Mom. 

I usually feel down and overwhelmed and hopeless, those wotfd bidn't help any. I'm not suicidal, but I could get there. I talked to someone earlier this week about groups and events I might try out.  

I know we need to have more income coming in. I know prices are going up. I know we need to eat better, and so on. We have insurance and taxes coming up, etc. We need security here. We need yard work, but I also need to take care of Mom. She's not that bad yet, but I drive her back and forth as we, no real alt transportation at this time. 

I'm at the end of my rope. We have cut back. We eat very cheap food, which really isn't good for her, too much sodium. We don't get clothes, even 2nd hand, very oftren. We can't even afford the $75 annual library card.

I could go on. I've done/am doing the best I can, and it's not enough.  I feel like a bunch of bad stuff is going to all come crashing down on me - and it's not going to end as well as Mom thinks it is. 

She's the eternal optimist.  I'm not. I'm scared.  I know what our neighbor could do, what she's subtly threatening to do.

Mom's going with me to the police this time.  For moral support, but also to show she isn't being abused. Then we have to go do the wash, and hopefully get home before it gets blazing hot. 

If any of the above strikes a chord, please give me/us support and/or advice. 

Thank you.

Hey everyone!  
I’ve been training a **Recurrent PPO** agent to play the classic **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Arcade)** game using only visual input. The goal is to teach the agent to fight through the levels using memory and spatial awareness, just like a human would.

Here are some key details:

* **Environment:** TMNT Arcade via custom Gymnasium + stable-retro integration
* **Observations:** 4 stacked grayscale frames at **160×160** resolution
* **Augmentations:** Random noise, brightness shifts, and cropping to improve generalization
* **Reward Signal:** Based on score increase, boss damage, and stage progression
* **Algorithm:** Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (RecPPO) with CNN + LSTM
* **Framework:** PyTorch with custom training loop (inspired by SB3)

The recurrent architecture has made a big difference in stability and long-term decision making. The agent is now able to consistently beat the first few levels and is learning to prioritize enemies and avoid damage.","At your service.

"Last Friday I was having my 8th carbo. Technically my 30th since I took a break last August until now but let’s just say 8th. 

I realized something was wrong and I told my mom to get the nurse. My throat closed and I panicked. I wasn’t getting oxygen. Finally the meds to help me kicked in and I puked twice then I thought I blacked out but I guess I mentally blacked out from panic? My heart felt like someone was crushing it and I do remember saying out loud I don’t want to die a few times or maybe I puked after that? I have no idea I’ve been trying to remember all week. They called an ambulance I went to the hospital and stayed over night to make sure there were no blood clots in my lungs. 


On Tuesday I went to the doctor and she told me a completely different story. She said I did have a reaction but it wasn’t as bad as my panic attack and it was unacceptable that I was flailing my arms around freaking everyone out saying I didn’t want to die and I didn’t pass out. She wasn’t there and she was going off what a nurse said. 

Her story doesn’t match mine and my mom was there but now she’s changing her story to match the nurses different from her original story, which was that I was passing in and out and what matched my story. She said they even turned me on my side so I didn’t choke on vomit. 

I don’t know which to believe and I have never had a panic attack like that before and I know I couldn’t breath but I have chemo again on Friday and I’m so ashamed to go because of the different stories. I would never want to freak others out and I honestly can’t remember much of what happened and I was ashamed when my doctor told me what happened at the doctors office because she was almost mad at me. My doctor has been awesome this whole time but her saying what I did was unacceptable and me having to face all the nurses is making me feel tired ashamed and really confused

I wasn’t really close to them since my family lived on the opposite side of the country. Only ever saw each other on really big occasions weddings or funerals that was it. After high school my cousin on my mom’s side “not one of said uncles kids” told me he was opening a restaurant and if I wanted to come work for him so I move out to Philly where my moms family is . About a year later my uncle’s health was failing and since I now lived in the same city as him I would visit him in the hospital and sit with him as he would tell old stories and I would read, him the newspaper. I felt bad none of his kids would visit so I would try to go every morning before my shifts. I didn’t do it because I was looking for a payout I just felt sorry for the guy. He dies and all of his 3 kids are left out of his will. I inherited all his assets about 1.4 million mostly in rental properties. As soon his kids learned this they became livid which I kinda get but they’re saying that my uncle was not of sound mind when he made that decision and are going to get lawyer. I want to end this peacefully with my cousins. I’ve pretty much made up my mind on splitting some the money with them. But two of them are currently battling drug and alcohol, addictions, and the youngest one well never properly diagnosed and I am not a doctor in anyway I am fairly certain he is schizophrenic. I don’t just want to give them a lump sum I just know they’d blow it. What can I do
Location: Pennsylvania",You can tell them to fuck off. If they're as addicted to drugs as you say they are then 1. They can't afford a lawyer and 2. Any lawyer taking crackhead clients isn't worth worrying about as long as you have a good lawyer of your own. All your lawyer has to point out at a hearing is that they're on crack. Their dad didn't speak to them for 25 years and they didn't visit him when he was dying which is a good indicator as to why they were left off the will.,concur
"Exactly what the title says. But more detail-

Let’s say things ended with someone- doesn’t even matter who ended it. And in that breakup discussion you were nicer to them than they deserved. Instead of telling them the ways they hurt you, you made it sound mutual and kind and blameless. But later, you thought about all the hurtful things they did that you let slide for whatever reason (avoiding conflict probably?) that you never brought up and they may not even realize they did.

Did going back after a breakup and telling someone how they did something wrong that hurt you make you feel better? Did it make you feel worse? Or, do you regret not having done it? ","Honestly the best way is to just leave without looking back. Nothing hurts more than realizing someone just walked away with no fight, no argument, no drama, no popping back up to try to reconnect...just leaving effortlessly and starting a new happy life with no regrets. I also dont block them or make my accounts private, I just unfollow them and move on. Dont post anything about them or try to start drama. I just shift my focus to being happy again. I know some of them probably check my accounts from time to time. Everyone now and then they'll show up viewing my stories...and thats really the best revenge in the end. They can see just how good my life is going, knowing they could be by my side enjoying it too, had they treated me with more kindness, respect, and compassion. Any harsh words or negativity at the end doesn't really do anything. When its over, its over. Move forward and realize the most devastating thing to them will be that they dont have you in their lives anymore.

"I am 28 M and my girlfriend is 38 F. This is my first serious relationship and we have been dating for a little over 6 months. She is incredible in so many ways and is very healthy emotionally. We both want marriage and kids. Lately though I have just been having an almost gut feeling to move on. There aren't any real red flags . Things that are probably just normal conflicts in relationships. But I've probably been bumping into it for the last month or so and pushing it away and then it comes back.

I feel horrible because I do love her but I think I feel pressure and lack of experience. If we want to start having kids we will have to get on it quickly because of her age. It's absolutely brutal decision because of how honestly great she is. I don't want to cop out and say I'm not ready but something in my gut and heart is saying to get out. I've definitely noticed red flags within myself of looking forward to being alone after we hang out and almost feeling weighed down. I have felt annoyed by phone calls. Things like that seem like my own red flags.

I just don't want to be an idiot and make a wrong decision. I'm gutted that I will likely be blindsiding her and hurting her significantly. These weigh in my head and make me feel guilty.

I'm torn by the fact that this has been a really great and beautiful relationship and I'm letting go of a potential great future with her. But part of me wonders if I'd be making a decision on pressure and if I'd regret and wonder about what if. I feel like I need to know.","Welcome to /r/relationship_advice.

"Hello!

My family moved into a new rental at the beginning of July. Less than a week after moving in, a police officer knocked on our door to inform us that our neighbor called the police because she believed we were “cooking drugs” in our unit. The officer stated that he had dealt with this neighbor several times in the past and he knew we were not engaged in any drug use.

Things calmed down for a little, but the other day, my wife said simple “hello” to the neighbor, who was staring at us as we walked by. The neighbor scoffed and was immediately hostile. This morning, I spotted the neighbor taking photos of our cars. I asked her why she was taking pictures, and she said “you know why, you’re druggies.” I mentioned that we are not drug users, and that we have a young daughter and my wife is expecting, to which she responded “yes, and I’m going to call Child Protective Services because of that.”

To be clear, the hardest drugs we have in the house are my wife’s antacids for pregnancy-related heartburn or my half-caf coffee. We do not even drink, let alone do any drugs. My job requires a drug test and background checks, including one from child protective services. 

I called the non-emergency line for our local PD and an officer responded. He told me they’ve interacted with this neighbor “dozens of times” and that she has some obvious mental health problems. He went to speak with her, but she somewhat quickly left her place out the back door, which I reported to the officer.

The officer advised us that, if this continues, to file harassment charges at the local magistrate. 

I also reached out to our new landlord to ask if there were any incidents with this neighbor in the past. He said no, but that this was a new property they were managing. I provided him with the incident number and the responding officer’s email.  He advised us to speak with a lawyer about this matter and would support us with the advice of counsel.

I am curious what we should do to prepare in this situation. We have never had issues with a neighbor before, especially for something that is completely unfounded. It feels like the local PD understands our situation, but I am still deeply uncertain living next to this person. I also do not want our new landlord to be suspicious of us because of what our mentally ill neighbor suspects. 

What are recommend next steps from a legal perspective on this matter?

TLDR Likely mentally ill neighbor called the cops on us for unfounded drug use. Police have dealt with her multiple times and even suggested harassment charges. Landlord advised speaking with counsel.

"I used to reach my phone before I even opened my eyes, not to check time, not because someone texted but just because. At one point it became so automatic that it was just my muscle memory at one point, like my thumb remember to unlock the phone. I was literally spending 6-7 hrs a day on my phone scrolling without any reason. Scroll, open ig/yt/reddit close then open again, close then the loop goes on.
Does anyone else also just feel exhausted all the time no matter what they do? 
Like i sit with my coffee and plan my day like I'm some kind of CEO or what planning my day on the notes app. It does looks productive, but somehow I still do absolutely nothing. Hours just vanish into scrolling random a$$ sh*t on ig reels or yt shots and then i feel worse like I'm stuck in an infinite loop fr.
My energy is unpredictable. Like on some days i get these random bursts and my brain wants to do everything at once. Other times i just scroll for 6 hours straight. either way, my to-do list laughs at me.
even the “just do one small thing” advice feels heavy when your energy’s shot. and when i do get a rare window of energy? i waste it switching between apps like a maniac until it’s gone. rinse. repeat.

but here’s what kinda helped without deleting any apps:

i moved all the scroll traps aka social apps (insta, reddit, youtube etc.) off my home screen and buried them deep in a random folder. Replaced that space with notes, calendar, or just boring apps. Girl also use that black and white/grayscale mode i assure you that you don't wan use your phone no longer.

i also stopped scheduling by time and started planning to do it in the exact moment I feel like doing it.

My dad goes into memory care on the 26th. Placement was something that was always kind of at the back of my mind but something I always kept putting off seriously pursuing. I was just being proactive and getting into for a “just in case I need it” scenario. When you’re caring 24/7 it’s just kind of something that always seems like it’s off on the other side of the horizon. 

I got the call this morning that a bed opened up and I really agonized over the choice. I saw the argument for placement and keeping him home. I called his friends, my friends, got their input and the resounding theme was that I’ve adjusted to a new kind of normal and don’t realize how much my level of responsibility has shifted. If it’s a slow boil, I’ll always find a way to justify it because every new lost ADL or level of care increase will become my new normal until there’s a crisis and I’m suddenly overwhelmed. 

I realized the other day that if my dad suddenly broke a leg or had a stroke and his care went to bed bound, I would be absolutely screwed. 

Finally, I talked to my dad about it. I know he couldn’t fully understand me but he was my rock and the person I always would have asked about hard decisions. He said something to the effect of “well, it never hurts to try something right? You can always go back” maybe, not as coherent as that but effectively that’s what he mean.  

I’m scared for him, nervous for him, but there’s a small part of me that really hopes that with the change of environment, he’ll finally stop hating me. 

I know he loves me, but he lashes out at me with every frustration. It’s not always anger but a lingering passive aggressiveness that I’m just not used to from him. He was always my best friend but also fiercely independent so the last couple years of 24/7 care have made him make me the enemy. Maybe with this move, when I show up, I can be present, happy and he’ll be happy to see me too. 

Anyone who has made this transition, specifically after being the sole caregiver for so long, how did it go after? ","Moving my mom to memory care was really hard emotionally. Some days are better than others, but she’s doing really well. I think making her world “smaller” really helped. We also found that medication management has gotten much better/easier, and that has helped a lot too. While we were touring the place she lives, the medical director said something that resonated at the time, and has turned out to be very accurate. She said when you move a loved one to memory care, it allows you to stop being a full time caregiver, and go back to being a family member. As you have found out, those are very different jobs. You are making the right decision. Memory care is treatment, not abandonment.",concur

I've(40m) been trying to figure why I feel so blah about trying to date again. It's been a year since I was out there on the apps. I tried more speed-dating events recently and they've been okay, but even with getting matches I just felt kind of over it.

I'm sure part of this is feeling hurt or jaded from past dating. However, I've come to realize that these feelings of meh are because I've actually been afraid to lose my emotional freedom. Personally I've been in sort of a transition period over the last year. It's only been in this time-frame that I've found the well in the clearing where self-compassion, self-love and ability to self-sooth reside. Still working on that muscle. So when I say emotional freedom I mean the ability to pour into my cup and not others. My last big relationship and all the people I've dated since have been about me pouring too much energy into them, leading to co-dependency and losing myself in the process. Yes, dating is emotionally exhausting, but I see that that's partly of my own doing.

Something else that's new for me is a sense of self-agency. I'm still trying process that and a lot of other things, but these feelings of self-agency have felt absent for my entire life. Which explains not being able to drive where I'm investing my emotional energy.

So the question I have for others is how much self-agency do you feel you have in a relationship? How much is healthy? I have to be honest, it's still making me uncomfortable thinking about showing love and kindness to myself while in a relationship as I'm afraid it will take away from a need I have to invest in the other person. I guess I'm partly looking for re-assurance that one should maintain some autonomy in a relationship and that it's okay to pour into your own cup. Yes, it sounds crazy to me to be writing that too. But I am still coming to terms with it and trying to see what it looks like in a relationship.

If your lymph nodes are clear (bear in mind, that only a biopsy is 100%) then you are ahead of this bastard and rare form of the disease. Try to stay that way.

"Location:  Oregon

On 06-01 I started working in this workplace, with a 2 year contract. This type of work requires custom tools per worker, which the company pays for.

The contract says that if you willingly don't work the time, without proper reason (health reasons or other manager approved situations) you are responsible to reimburse the company. This applies if you miss 20% of your hours in a 31 day span.

And you are liable for any overtime paid to others that have to finish your job, if you don't work with the proper reason.

If you get fired, you aren't responsible for the cost of tools or overpay. And with permission can take the tools with you.

On 07-02 I got in to an conflict with a coworker. The reason for the conflict had risen when he tried to give me tasks that weren't my job to handle.

He made a complaint to one of the managers (I had a direct manager, who this person wasn't), and I got fired. Reason being as this wasn't the first complaint about me, which in theory wouldn't surprise me.

On 07-10 I got a call from my direct manager asking why I wasn't in for a week. I explained the situation, and he said that the other manager doesn't have power to fire me. And that I am in breach of contract.

I have the firing in writing in my email, but the call went so fast I forget to get to it.

My direct manager said something close to ""As this is a legal issue now, all our contract must go through our legal department. Please don't come in, as that would be trespassing.""

Yesterday (07-22) I got an email from the legal department claiming damages and tool cost of 300$.

Do I need a lawyer in this case? Or now? What are my options? Was the firing legal in the first place?",If someone in a position of power emailed you that you were fired present that to the legal team and explain that you will not be paying them any reimbursement.

Me and my siblings are going through a lot right now and we simply can't make a decision. It's constant feeling of push and pull in the mind.

Is there recommended reading about how best to interact with family members who have memory loss and confabulation?

My mother was an avid drinker, which lead to her being diagnosed with Wernicke’s Korsakoff Syndrome. She has been sober now for almost two months and is experiencing short-term memory loss and confabulation, and it doesnt seem to be getting better. Her father had alzheimer’s as well, so I’m worried about how she might progress going forward. 

I’m not sure if I should correct her when she fills in the gaps, or if I should “live in her new reality” as a counselor put it. I worry about how I should talk with her when she miss remembers or remembers completely wrong. One of my fears is about how I speak with her about her friends who have passed and she doesnt remember. Do I tell her, or let her continue to live in her current memory?

Are their groups to help family members deal with their stress and fatigue?

Thanks for your time 🙏🏻 It is appreciated. ","Hello! I looked into it on Chat GPT for you! And just so you know, you’re absolutely in the right place, and it’s great that you’re reaching out. Caring for someone with Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome can be really tough, especially with memory loss and confabulation! This next part is from Chat: • Don’t always correct her. If the memory is harmless or comforting, it’s okay to go along with it. If it’s distressing, try gently redirecting her instead of arguing. • When she forgets someone has passed, it’s often kinder not to remind her—especially if it causes grief all over again. Redirect with love: “They loved you so much” or “You always had such good times together.” • You’re not alone. Look into books like The 36-Hour Day, and check out support groups through the Alzheimer’s Association or Reddit communities like r/caregivers. • Take care of yourself. Groups like Al-Anon or caregiver support groups can really help you cope with the emotional load. My loved one also suffers from confabulation. Meet her in her mind. Today, I agreed to pay “my share” of the house phone bill. In her mind, the service fees were phone calls that had been made long distance, including to my daughter’s school, 10 miles up the road. I don’t use the house phone, of course, but I agreed to it, and was able to de-escalate in about 30 minutes. If I would’ve argued, attempted to present logic or reason, it would’ve made everything 10x worse. Good luck, and I hope this helped!",concur

"Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to post this. I am 29 and all my life I have resisted the temptation of abusing (whatever they call it (they always make it sound so duragatory)) drugs, but for the first time ever, tonight, I decided to take a large dose of my medication (4x my daily dose). It is a benzo medication and I have been so good at taking it as prescribed), but I have been struggling with mental health for 7 years since I was sexually assaulted as a male and have subsequently been assaulted 4 more times since, and I've been mocked and ridiculed for it. I have PTSD from it. I have struggled with hating myself since the mocking began and have been told I deserve it or that I need to suck it up or that men cant be assaulted, and a few days ago, I had a meltdown and smashed a few bottles of soap in my bathroom and my parents said that doing so has stressed them out as much as being sexually assaulted stressed me out and that I should feel more compassion and be more considerate to them and what I did was abusive and I just feel like Im a terrible person and for the past 2 days I heavily contemplated ending my life, and 2 hours ago I was about to drive off in the night to god knows where, but I looked at my medication bottle, and I just quickly and randomly decided to take 4x the normal dose and right now I feel so good. I feel so much peace. Peace I haven't felt in years. A calmness, a lack of anxiety. My doctor has tried me on a lot of medications and none of them work or make my depression worse and I've exhausted all SSRIs and SNRIs and other various medications and I am not looking for, nor do I want medical advice. All I am saying is that I think I finally get it. After all of these years, being labeled the ""good grandson"", the ""good nephew"", being labled ""good"" for not doing drugs. I have been on and off the benzo medication and I have been on and off opioid medication for painful medical conditions that require surgery every 6-18 months and I always took my meds as prescribed, but tonight I did something I never did before and I'm terrified I just opened the gates of hell and am about to decend. Withdrawal already sucks a hell of a lot when taking these meds as prescribed (my great aunt believes you don't get withdrawal if you take it properly but thats not true at all), but after the hell my life has been over the past 7 or 8 years, I've finally given in. Tonight it was either end my life or take the pills. Ive called crisis lines before and they always judge me. My therapists have judged me. My psychiatrist and doctors judge me. I'm sick and tired of this judgement. Im sick and tired of being ""the favourite"" or ""the good child"". I don't feel like doing this anymore. I resisted for this long, and tbh, I am not surprised people get addicted to drugs and alcohol. Right now with the high I'm on, I'll be very honest, I wish I took it sooner. I don't know what this will mean for my future. All my life the advice has been ""say no to drugs"", or ""it isn't worth it"". Life doesn't feel ""worth it"" anymore. I've had enough. Therapy and meds don't work. I've been doing therapy and meds for 8 years and people just are so fricking judgmental and I can't take it anymore. I can't take the therapy anymore with how useless it's been. I can't take my parents nor their friend's judgement anymore with how I don't have a job and how they know people who have PTSD and have been sexually assaulted who live just fine. Overall, screw society. It's been horrible to people who are addicted to drugs. People who are hurting so much. People who would probably be dead if they didn't take their drug of ""choice"". It's not a choice. God I hate people... What do I do? Therapy has failed me, my ""support system"" is beyond exessive with judgement, all the addiction supports are for people already addicted to substances. I am not addicted yet, but my resistance is beginning to fail. As I said, and as I have labled this post: ""I feel like I am about to decend into hell."" Although honestly, I think I've already been in hell for a long time. I just haven't used substances to cope with being in hell yet. I have been in constant physical and psychological pain for years now and the medical system won't support me or provide any reliefe other than ""Practice mindfulness"" ""just breath"". Sure. I can do that. I can breath. I've been breathing for 29 years. Its what keeps my brain functioning. I've already sustained a brain injury from an accident, so I'm not particularly concerned about how drugs can cause brain damage. I've been clinically dead already. What difference does it make wether it be from a head trauma or from overdosing? At least overdosing feels good. I've technically been overdosed on pain meds, however it was in a post surgical setting where I was in so much agony that they gave me so much pain meds that my breathing became completely voluntary and they had to pat my face and tell me to breath ever 5-10 seconds for 4 hours before my pain was managed and I safely passed out. I don't know. I feel like I'm at a breaking point.

"EDIT - we met up this morning and he ended it. He said he’s told me a million times that he is secular and that the main reason that “tipped him over the edge” was the fact that I have been making out that he is lying. I was gobsmacked and asked him why this is and he said that he has explained his religion vs traditional culture to me many times and that because I “keep asking him about it” it makes him think that there is no trust. I told him that that is not the case at all and that whilst I remember bits of what he’s told me about his tradition and his views there has never been any conversation about what he expects from myself. I also reminded him that a few weeks ago I proactively brought it up and said that I wanted to understand it more (when we were chilling and watching TV) and he said he was too tired to chat about it. He responded by saying that that is beside the point… he then walked off. 😔😔😔


We’ve been dating for 6 months now (I’m 36f and he’s 38m) and everything had been going great. We have had little disagreements but they’ve been dealt with in an emotionally mature way. I love this man so much and honestly thought he was/is the one so I feel heartbroken and torn apart . 

I attended a Sunday dinner at my boyfriend’s auntie’s house last week and felt confused and out of place because I was the only non-Christian attendee. My boyfriend told me that it would be a religious affair and that there would be singing. I assumed that it would be fun singing but instead it was incredibly formal and more like hymns. 

I called him this morning to talk through the dinner from last Sunday because I was still mulling it over. He tells me he’s not religious but then he knew all the prayers by heart, so I’m confused. During the phone call I start asking him questions about it and I tell him that I’m confused. He reacts badly and says that this conversation is weird. I reiterated that I didn’t have a bad time at the thinner but that it was way more formal than I thought it would be and I did express some concerns about my role in this. Would I be expected to go to these dinners on a regular basis? Do I need to know the hyms? Etc et  

Fast forward 6 hours, he texts me and I can tell he is super pissed off, he is saying that he is not religious but practices the traditions and that he feels like I misinterpreted him and his family and he feels disrespected. I explain that I am not trying to poke him but instead I’m wanting to learn about it so that I can take things on board for our future. I also told him that I flew to the Middle East years ago to work for a Christian aid think tank… So I am definitely not opposed to the religion. And I was still so confused as to Why has he taken this the wrong way?? I’m confused about the distinction between what is a tradition and what is religion and what role (if any I would I’ve to play).  The only thing that I specifically thought we had discussed is having our children baptised but he said this would be a tradition which I agreed with. 

He then started to get angry and said “I am not a religious Christian who is practising but I was born one. And the fact that I am having to convince you that I am not Christian is weird and unacceptable and I will never justify myself to anyone. My family are my world and you have issues with them. I am appalled that I asked you to be my girlfriend. I couldn’t care about religion but this is my culture and I won’t tolerate being interrogated by you ever again. We can chat tomorrow”. 

Any advice on how I navigate this? I genuinely want to understand and support him but he’s taken my questions as disrespect. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations where your partner identifies with a religion culturally but claims not to be religious? How do I approach this without him feeling attacked? And did my actions warrant his angry reaction? 😫😫😫

Edit: Something I just remembered, he has been working flat out for most of our relationship and has a new job in accounting. He has told me numerous times that at this moment in time (over the next 6 months or so), he has de-prioritised social events with friends but still made time to see me. He said that once his probation ends he will become more “normal” with his work life balance. So I think what I was trying to get at is how often would 
 I have to attend these things when his work has calmed down as last night was the first time. I did not communicate that to him btw which I should have done 

Also an example of our past disagreements… he has loads of photos on Facebook of him with loads of girls out partying (these photos are months apart and not every weekend). And in about 7/8 photos he has his arms wrapped around girls with them kissing his cheeks. In the first month of us dating I showed my friend his Facebook and she saw all of the photos, and said that he looks like a player. Prior to this I had only seen two of these types of photos and had not done a detailed look at his FB like my friend so I had a wierd feeling about it. I called him up a few hours later when she’d gone and asked him about it calmly. I remember saying that I want to understand why these photos are there because it infers that you’re not after a relationship? I also followed up with that I get the opposite impression from you in real life so it’s confusing for me. He got very very defensive and said that he can have any photos that he wants on social media etc etc and that I should trust him for who he is in person. I can’t exactly remember how the conversation ended but he reassured me that he doesn’t want a casual fling. So maybe this is contributing to how he’s feeling now ","Sounds like he is Christian at heart but weird about it. Your questions probably provoked his own mixed feelings or he's defensive because he knows you won't like the honest answers. Perhaps you fear that you will be expected to take on a role as a Christian wife, which is very valid and a real possibility when you become part of this family.",oppose

"A friend of mine got out of a LTR back in October of 2024. After some time spent on getting back on track, she started dating again around March: since then, she's in a sort of situationship with a man (mid 30s as well as her). Me and her catch up like once a week, and she opens up a bit about how's it going with him. Now, the issue is that I worry about her, hence the post. I am aware of attachment theory because it comes from core wounds and beliefs mostly developed in early childhood, and I myself am in therapy to overcome many maladaptive coping mechanisms that led me to abandon the idea of dating for the forseeable future. 

This man my friend is dating is showing pretty strong avoidant tendencies and behaviors. In addition to the situationship itself, he showed difficulty in talking about labels (she described it as him having an anxiety attack), difficulty in opening up (it's ok to talk about how the day went but the question ""how did that make you feel"" gets dodged or deflected), troubles with intimacy (as in, he needs space right after sex, it happens occasionally and my friend is VERY good looking, so I doubt it's a physical attraction issue), no texting for some days after dates. 

Because I am aware of the word ""avoidant"", I mentioned this to my friend, maybe clumsily, as a way to introduce her to the concept. She did a bit of research and was surprised by how this fits the guy she's dating. Unfortunately, she's already attached, and, despite the warnings, she'd still like to see if the relationship progresses. She's highly independent, emotionally intelligent, has many many different hobbies, a good network of friendships, definitely not the type to vomit her emotions onto you. Yet she's also someone who values communication, who likes to talk about problems and emotions and tries to understand you. And I fear this is just a no go with someone with his level of avoidance, despite them wanting the same things in the future (marriage and kids). I am worried she's gonna get hurt sometime down the line. So, help a worried gal out, is anyone here in a successful, solid partnership with someone avoidant (not in therapy as far as I know)? I think I already know the answer and ultimately I am aware this is her life and her decision to make..I just don't want to see her going through another heartbreak.

TL;DR: is anyone in a successful, solid partnership with someone avoidant (not in therapy as far as I know)? Worried for a friend who'd like to try this out.","Tell her to stop trying to diagnose his attachment style and start assessing their compatibility based on how he’s showing up in her life **currently**. Remind her to live in the present and to trust in the validity of her **current** experience, rather than thinking future-state about how things “could” be *if* (and it’s an unlikely if) he somehow overcomes his “fears”** of commitment. Patience and understanding will never fix a person who is content with you being unhappy while they’re getting their needs met. She’s being a martyr for a relationship that will never fulfill her, because he has no incentive or desire to improve. **side note: ultimately, the line between “avoidant” and “not that into you but you’re good enough for now as long as you keep meeting my needs and have no expectations of me”…is nonexistent.",concur

Plus we're always worried that medications might make her unsteady on her feet so we are reluctant to use them unless she seems to be really suffering. As long as the hallucinations are not upsetting, we just go with them. It's just part of the disease, like asking the same question over and over again. If the hallucinations are upsetting we try to tell her that it's just a dream and she never believes us but we can't very well let her sleep under the dining room table either so that's when it gets really hard.

"**Edit:** Putting this at the top. To explain my situation a bit better and maybe to put things another way, I think I'm having a hard time with dating again because currently I feel happy a lot of the time and am actually doing okay being single. But a big part of that is me putting a lot of energy into being intentional about how I take care of myself. I think dating other people will throw that energy off. I'm still navigating this and trying to find a healthier relationship with my approach to dating and being around other people.

\-

I've(40m) been trying to figure why I feel so blah about trying to date again. It's been a year since I was out there on the apps. I tried more speed-dating events recently and they've been okay, but even with getting matches I just felt kind of over it.

I'm sure part of this is feeling hurt or jaded from past dating. However, I've come to realize that these feelings of meh are because I've actually been afraid to lose my emotional freedom. Personally I've been in sort of a transition period over the last year. It's only been in this time-frame that I've found the well in the clearing where self-compassion, self-love and ability to self-sooth reside. Still working on that muscle. So when I say emotional freedom I mean the ability to pour into my cup and not others. My last big relationship and all the people I've dated since have been about me pouring too much energy into them, leading to co-dependency and losing myself in the process. Yes, dating is emotionally exhausting, but I see that that's partly of my own doing.

Something else that's new for me is a sense of self-agency. I'm still trying process that and a lot of other things, but these feelings of self-agency have felt absent for my entire life. Which explains not being able to drive where I'm investing my emotional energy.

So the question I have for others is how much self-agency do you feel you have in a relationship? How much is healthy? I have to be honest, it's still making me uncomfortable thinking about showing love and kindness to myself while in a relationship as I'm afraid it will take away from a need I have to invest in the other person. I guess I'm partly looking for re-assurance that one should maintain some autonomy in a relationship and that it's okay to pour into your own cup. Yes, it sounds crazy to me to be writing that too. But I am still coming to terms with it and trying to see what it looks like in a relationship.

This post might also help others. Definitely encourage you to think about where you actually are with these things personally.

Also, I really appreciate everyones in-depth response to my last post.","I think codependency exists on a spectrum from those who give of themselves without reservation or boundaries, often leading them to chase people who aren't willing to commit or give back equally, to people who *know* they have a tendency towards enmeshment and overcommitment, and to protect themselves/compensate veer avoidant or fearful of attachment. I think the latter one might be you. I would say this is an understandable reaction to feeling like previous relationships and people expected too much from you. I'm a total broken record about this book, but it really changed my outlook and approach to dating, *If the Buddha Dated* by Charlotte Kasl. One of the things she talks about is using red flags from previous relationships to create boundaries in dating moving forward. What did you ignore last time around that led you to be hurt or taken advantage of? What signs should you look for to avoid that situation in the future. I did this exercise with my ex in mind and what I kept coming to was the pervasive feeling in my relationship with him, from the earliest points, that he didn't want to be around me. I felt like I was being kept at a distance and I was always trying to close that. I decided that if I ever felt that again with someone, if I had to doubt their affection or attraction, I was going to cut my losses and leave. I did do that a couple times. What was interesting is that my ex spent our relationship pinning this dynamic as introvert (him) vs extrovert (me). My current partner is an introvert, every once in a while he takes time to himself, time to go do things with his family and his friends, and it's never been an issue. Because of the way he does it, the reliability he's already demonstrated, I never feel like him needing some time away is a sign that he's pushing me away. Where my ex felt like my extroversion made me a bad partner for his introvert nature, my current partner thinks I'm incredibly accommodating to introverts. So I say all this to say to you: YOU have the power to walk away, and there is nothing wrong with that. I think there is so much bs going around different dating subreddits about how people walk away over nothing and don't want to work on things. I *wish* I had had the confidence, 11 years ago, to walk away in the first couple months (honestly, we both should have left. I wasn't perfect then either. I'm glad we didn't, so many important things in my life came from that relationship and I wouldn't trade that, but looking back there was no reason for us to try and ""make it work"" when we were having issues a couple months in). People don't walk away quickly enough. I do think people turn prospective dates away for dumb reasons, but that's different. Give people a shot but when they fail you don't have to stick around. If your concern is a fear of enmeshment and self-abandonment, you can test for that early on. See how they react when you take time for yourself. If you can't do something they ask, do they get mad, or do they figure something else out? We're in our 30s and 40s, we should be able to self-soothe when our partners aren't available. Don't give up. My partner is someone who I think keeps pretty strong boundaries with people, except when he decides you're in the inner circle, and then he's completely devoted. I actually need to remind him that filling his own cup first, even before mine or our families, is necessary. His ability to be a good partner to me is only sustainable through being good to himself. He's pretty good about making sure he gets what he needs, but I sometimes I want to remind him we put our own oxygen mask first for a reason.",concur
"M/40s here - I come from a lifetime of being attracted to unavailable people, which lasted until my late 30s.

Since then, I've undergone extensive therapy and reflection, and I've also taken a significant period off from dating, as I couldn't be sure that I wouldn't fall into the same pattern.

Fast forward to two months ago: I'm told by my work that I'm being transferred to New York, and I end up writing a Facebook post about it. My friend then introduces me to another friend of hers who also lives in the Big Apple, suggesting that we'll get along like a house on fire.

Messaging leads to phone calls, which in turn lead to her flying to Europe on a whim, and us spending a few days together in Italy. Since then, we've been calling and messaging every single day, exchanging millions of words.

On paper, she's everything I've ever wanted in a partner - brilliant (intellectually), beautiful, kind, with just the right amount of playful attitude, the list could go on.

And yet, I have a feeling that I'm walking into the same trap. Factors that lead me to believe so:

\- Although we've met, and I'll soon be in New York too, much of our getting to know each other is happening online, likely creating a false impression of me in her mind and vice versa, which means that when we meet again, problems will likely arise.

\- She has bipolar 2. Although she's taking medicine for it, seeing a therapist and medical professional, and does mindfulness exercises, I got involved with several women during the time that I chased after unavailable people

\- I live a solid middle-class lifestyle, whereas she and her family are incredibly wealthy. I have no reason to believe that she would use the wealth disparity to demean me - she seems pretty grounded. Still, on the other hand, I've seen several examples of wealth disparities in relationships that have been a major cause for stress and eventual divorce.

Ultimately, I'm unsure whether I'm sabotaging myself by trying to predict the future or whether I have grounds to believe I'm repeating a familiar pattern.

Any advice would be appreciated!","You mentioned her being diagnosed and treated with bipolar 2 disorder. It sounds like she’s following treatment; is there anything that stands out as a red flag? I am diagnosed the same and have been stable for a long time. I trend towards hypomania, but I know what that could look like (hyper, irritable, don’t need sleep), and so I’ll take my sleeping meds as needed and a day off maybe once a month or two, and I’m fine. I’ve been in my relationship for 9 months and it’s super healthy. I’m likely projecting, but personally unless something stands out, or if she’s told you about episodes that might concern you, I wouldn’t cut her out if things are going well otherwise. That’s just my opinion - take it or leave it :-)",concur
"Do the hard thing in your life.The “hard thing” in your life might not be what others expect. For one person, it’s starting a business. For someone else, it’s walking into a room full of strangers. And that’s the thing, “hard” is personal. That’s why it matters.

I’ve had this weird fear of being seen or judged, and for a long time, I avoided anything that made me feel exposed or vulnerable. I wouldn’t speak up, I’d avoid people, and just drift under the blanket because it felt safer.

"I went out on just a couple dates with someone. He ghosted me when I wasn’t able to meet as often as he’d like (we were meeting weekly) as I had let him know i had just gotten out of something and I needed time to process everything (EDIT: I said this because i was being asked to commit to being exclusive the next week). He came back and apologized a month later saying he could sense my “disinterest” (meanwhile i had made clear my interest - despite hesitation of doing so so early- multiple time during the dates) and I said its ok but I was surprised he felt that way because I was beyond transparent even though it felt hard to be so transparent so early in dating (early dating should be light and fun). I tried to ask how he was doing but he ghosted again. Perhaps because he again thought i was not interested.

So i gave it sometime and did something I wish someone had done for me when i had been insecure in the past and jumped the gun of someones “interest” - i sent him a text letting him know it was too much too soon when he questioned my interest during those dates. That id be open to reconnecting but only if our paces align- because our paces feel mismatched.  He replied that he would be open too and he acknowledged his issues on making it heavy early on. When i assured him ive done the same in the past and then i tried to keep it light again by asking about his going ons… silence which i dont mind - i dont care if someone ghosts like that.

"Hello all, thanks for reading this. I hope it doesn't become too meandering but I suppose I'm not sure where to start.

I (32m) have been with my gf (28f) for over 7 years now. She has long struggled with her mental health, ADHD we thought, though in the past year or so she has now been saying she is autistic (no official diagnoses). We both have our traumas and I have my own bad brain problems, so working through this and supporting her have always been a given for me, and I've never been one to hold any of it against her.

But I feel she's getting so much worse. She will spend entire days in a semi-disassociated state where she has difficulty taking care of herself, eating, or performing any kind of day-to-day obligations. She's always struggled with work, but the past year-and-a-half or so she's begun to talk about how she ""just can't work"" and ""won't work full time unless it's for herself"" (she wants to start a business). As of now, she works 2 days a week which covers her portion of the bills and the basics, but I really fear for our future. We both have ideas, plans, and aspirations, but how does one build toward this if their partner can only work two days a week and is having breakdowns about how \*that\* is too much?

She has this habit of entering this kind of childlike state? I don't know what to call it, I guess. But she will only communicate via whines or gestures, curls up in blankets on the floor, get upset if I try to make actual communication happen, and totally checks out of being an adult, or a partner. I totally understand indulging your inner child, but this will go on for DAYS and I can barely communicate in any real way with her. In these states, she's nearly totally incapable of caring for herself and I enter a kind of caretaker mode. 

The house is filthy, I do all the cooking and do what I can with the cleaning, but I work a LOT and much of the real issues in the house are strictly her stuff, which I cannot really do anything about without risking a meltdown on her part. 

We've talked a lot, these past couple months, about all of this. Our discussions usually (especially if it's an issue I'm bringing up or that she feels responsible for) devolve into her sobbing, shutting down, or getting VERY angry. I feel that I can't talk at all about my issues in our relationship, my feelings, or my needs, without her spiraling like this. 

All of the above, some more than others, has DRASTICALLY impacted our sex life. I have a very hard time feeling attracted to her when she's in these states (especially that ""little"" (as she calls it) state, for obvious reasons). 

We had a bit of a breakthrough lately, and she professed to a lot of shame and guilt. She feels this way about all the ways she thinks she's ""failing"", but doesn't feel like she can do anything about it. And if I speak (gently!) about something she's feeling this way about, she explodes. We both understand this, now, but it hasn't changed. 

We also talked about our sex life and attraction, and agreed to make an effort to engage in that intimacy as we both think it's important. However, she's put a kind of strange (to me) set of rules in place for us. She suggested that we ""act like we're just starting out again"" and ""totally take sex off the table"". She has a kind of process in mind (hugging > cuddling > kissing > etc) and wants to rule anything further off until ""the vibe is right"". I felt a little lost, but I told her I was willing to try. I also told her I wanted to leave that ball in her court (as far as initiating, as I don't know how fast she wants to move or where her comfort level might be in this). But it's been nearly a month now and we've barely even kissed, and bringing it up causes a blowup. I feel like physical affection (forget sex) has become a weapon.

How far is too far, I guess? She's quit therapy (no money, won't work) and has always refused to see a psych, even though we KNOW she's at least fighting ADHD. I have offered to pay for either but she won't commit. At this point, often, when we hit a roadblock she'll just tell me ""it's because I'm autistic"" or she'll pull up a tiktok of someone talking about a symptom of autism that she identifies with, as if she expects it to totally absolve her of responsibility. I try to be understanding, but sometimes it just feels like she's using it as a weapon.

I love this girl, she wasn't always like this and I know she's an incredibly strong and capable woman in there, but I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I want to help, but I know I'm really just enabling. I am trying to leave her to fend for herself more rather than falling into this kneejerk caretaker response, but it's equally difficult to simply watch her go through this. I don't know what to do, and I feel no matter how I approach it, approaching it all makes me the bad guy. I'm tired of being screamed at, or woken from a dead sleep to her slamming around throwing things and yelling at me because I forgot to dry her laundry or she can't find something, I'm tired of navigating a relationship where I feel like everything is a landmine.

I've begun to have literal, real health problems due to stress (not just relationship stress, other stuff too for sure) and get actual dizzy spells and nausea when I hear her come home or I pull into home after work. When she realized she was part of the cause of this, I spent the rest of the night pulling her out of a hole she had spiraled into because she felt bad. Meanwhile, I can't stay on my feet because my head is spinning!

Any advice? How can I help without sabotaging us or committing to this self-perpetuating cycle we're in? I am trying to talk her into couples therapy, but we've tried it before. At this point, I feel so burnt out and emotionally-drained that it's turning into resentment. Thinking about ending it is heart-wrenching, and I'd be so afraid for her if I did, but I can't stop thinking about how amazing it would be to be with someone that gives me as much as I give them, rather than taking advantage and still treating me like I'm not enough. I can't even remember the last time she asked me if \*I\* was okay and I feel so lonely.

TL;DR - long term relationship is stuck in a horrible cycle, I feel more like a caretaker than a partner. What do we even do at this point?

Thank you for reading.","Sweetheart, she doesn't need couples counseling right now; she needs individual therapy and she needs it immediately. She needs to get diagnosed with whatever's going on with her mental health, she needs to get on a meds regimen and she needs to start working with a counselor on strategies to help her deal with it. And if she won't do these things, then you need to ask yourself how long you're willing to continue in this relationship. Look, I know you care about her, but this relationship is far from healthy. She doesn't do the bare minimum to contribute to the household, she screams at you, she slams and throws things around, and in short, this is abusive. Your mental health is in the toilet, your physical health is now being affected, and you need to get away from her. Please take a look at [these signs](https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/domestic-abuse-warning-signs/) and [this infographic](https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/power-and-control/) and see if you recognize your relationship.",concur
"I’m gonna say it off the bat i know i am not a good person or justifying my actions. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months now. He is a very sweet guy and I was happy until about 7 months ago (i’ve been away for summer for 3 months) so i haven’t been around him much. Most of our time hanging out is with his roommates which i am also close with, but i’ll come back to that later. 

This summer, i have been snapping one of his roommates that i’ve had because we are all chill and he lives in the same home town city sometimes bc of his mom. we instantly connected and i realized how infatuated i was with him. which i always wanted to get to know him and was drawn to him just not to the level or type of interest i am now.

 we talk every day, call every day. while on the other hand my boyfriend is horrible as communicating with me which ive talked to him about and he fails make an effort to change. he only asks me abt my day and we’re long distance which is already hard enough. 

i also noticed how majority of the time him and i are alone he doesn’t say much, which i missed bc we are hanging out in the group setting 80% of the time. 

the roommate and i have a perfect connection and even finish each others thoughts or sentences/seem to have a weird empathic connection. 

he came back to his hometown to see his mom so i saw him and we may have cuddled and kissed and everything felt so right. 

i feel bad for my bf but at the same time o know he’s not the one for me.
","While there is nothing wrong with realizing someone else is a better fit for you, you shouldn’t have cheated regardless. Just break up with your boyfriend and have a conversation with the roommate about whether he’s cool with blowing up his living situation to be with you.

"So first off, I never thought I would go to reddit for anything my life; but, here I am. 

**Background description --** I'll keep it simple, it isn't a problem with her, it is an issue with me. 

For prior reference, she is so amazing and has listened to every single word that has made me feel this way and she has been so supportive. She is just so tired all of the time, because right now, she is traveling across the country for a few weeks and just hasn't a lot of free time of her own to think on this, which I understand. (We have been dating for 8.5ish months!) I am also a busy person myself, I run, I keep busy with my activities so I am doing something fulfilling pretty much every second of the day.

**Main Topic --** I just feel like I put myself in a mental cage and I have lost my mental self in our relationship. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing our relationship is and how understanding we are, it's just so hard right now to think through all of this myself. For specific examples, I feel like I am fighting myself everyday and every second on the precise way I text or talk to her. I NEED everything to be perfect all of the time, and it is hurting me. I find myself rereading texts LITERALLY at least 10 times checking to make sure I have covered everything. I want to just to make sure I don't miss anything because the times she isn't busy I treat like gold. I also find myself responding so quickly just at the slightest chance at having a conversation with her if she isn't busy, which we've talked about and hopefully fixed. 

I just put myself in a mental jail to where sometimes I only think about her and I get so angry about everything I do or the little things. I've realized I've wrongfully trained myself for MONTHS to where I don’t wanna feel like I’m doing anything wrong by leaving things out or not doing things either, and I don’t want either of us to resent each other for it. I feel like I’m letting her down if I don’t do all of these things EVERY second and not doing my best for her all of the time (even though she deserves every ounce of love)

TLDR; I've lost myself and my touch mentally.

**Any advice on how to continue and get mentally in tune?** I don't need to go outside more or anything, I am busy most of the day, I just need advice on how to get back to the way I was earlier in our relationship and not the worrying guy I am.

"I’m not sure how it came about, but I was with him on the phone and we were joking around. I just started a work situation which will remove me from my home country to another for two months at a time, every couple months. This was the first two months, and I was a bit worried about our relationship. However, it all went perfectly. I was not worried at all, even though I struggle with intense anxiety. We didn’t text much or feel the need to constantly talk, but sometimes when I grabbed my phone to text him that I missed him, I would see he had texted me the same just minutes before. I’m happy to have time to focus on myself, but also miss him dearly. 

Anyway, I was joking about this “timeline” I have for my life which would include getting engaged and/or married in my late twenties, and how I told my friend that “if he doesn’t change drastically, I wanna get engaged to him in 3 years” and he immediately went “oh, I told my friend more like in 2 years…” 

Our relationship is still quite fresh, so this engagement estimate might or might not happen; and in any case the wedding would not immediately follow. But, not so long ago, I was in a severely abusive relationship that I still fight the effects of. I thought my life was forever changed, and that it would take me ages to find happiness again, and that I’d never be ready to trust someone again. As I said it’s fresh, so the honeymoon feelings are still very real, but I’ve never felt so safe and cared for in any other relationship, at any time in it. He just doesn’t give me anything to stress or worry about. We resolve our conflicts very well, and he honestly inspires me to become a better person, which I’ve also never felt before. I’m making leaps and bounds in therapy and combatting the lasting effects of being in an abusive situation such as PTSD, anxiety, and anger. He’s just so nice to me that it makes me want to be nothing but nice and caring back! And I don’t have to be the bigger person at all, it’s simply what he deserves for how he treats me and everyone else in his life.

After being in an abusive situation; it feels impossible to trust again, but he proves to me time and time again that he appreciates me as I appreciate him, and that I am not being duped again, and that he does really care for me. I always like when he tells me he talks about me to his friends, but the fact that he’s talking about possibly proposing to me made me feel so unbelievably fuzzy. We’re both young, it might not happen that way, but the fact that he wants to right now and is voicing that makes me so happy. It’s also nice because I’ve known I wanted to get married eventually for a while, but could not imagine any of my exes at the end of the isle, for some reason? It just felt out of place, or unrealistic, or it just didn’t make sense as an image. 
I can imagine him clear as day though, and think about it sometimes. 
","Thank you very much! I have become very very protective of my happiness since escaping that situation. I realised I cannot help others actions, I can only protect and prioritise myself and those who give me joy, which was not something I was actively doing back then. It’s been a massive journey of waking up and coming out of being an anxious people pleaser. Also agree on the time away!

I've applied to over 500 jobs since I was laid off from my previous position. Despite all my efforts, I’ve received more rejections than interviews. Right now, I’m working at Dollar General, making $11 an hour with no benefits, trying to support two people.

Every day, I push forward and hope for a better opportunity, but it’s hard not to feel discouraged. I have experience, I’m willing to work, and I’ve proven I can handle pressure — yet it feels like no one is giving people like me a real chance.

"Location: Dallas, Texas. Just moved out of my apartment last week after living there for 2 years. When I moved in the place was honestly pretty gross, stained carpet, scuff marks everywhere, kitchen hadn't been properly cleaned in ages.  
  
I spent my entire last weekend scrubbing everything down, steam cleaned the carpets myself, filled nail holes, even touched up some paint. Place looked better than it did when I moved in, took tons of photos as proof.  
  
Got my ""move out statement"" yesterday and they're trying to charge me $2800 in various cleaning fees. $800 for carpet cleaning, $600 for ""deep cleaning kitchen,"" $400 for ""wall repair and painting,"" and a bunch of other random charges. They're saying they're keeping my entire $1200 deposit plus I owe them an additional $1600.  
  
The kicker is I've been really careful about saving money this year and actually have photos from my move-in inspection that show the place was way worse when I got there. But now they're claiming normal wear and tear is somehow my responsibility.  
  
Is this legal? Can they really charge me for cleaning when the apartment was spotless? I'm willing to fight this but don't know where to start.

"I’m 19, from India. I’m taking a drop year to prepare for CLAT, a national level law entrance exam. If I clear it, I want to get into a decent private law university. Not because it’s top tier or flashy, but because it would give me a strong foundation, structure, and the credibility I’ll need to build anything from scratch. I don’t have rich connections or extraordinary talent. I just need a solid starting point.

The total cost of this 5 year BBA LLB course is about ₹19 lakh ($22,800). Add hostel fees (₹60k per semester), mess (₹22k per semester), and monthly expenses (₹10k just to survive), and I’m staring at a ₹35 lakh ($42k) financial wall.

Here’s the truth. My family is lower middle class. That kind of money isn’t just tight, it’s non existent. We don’t have savings or fallback options. And every day, the pressure to figure it out is crushing me.

Some people say take a cheaper college, but for me, this college isn’t a luxury. It’s the only real shot I have at building something long term. A cheap degree without structure, internships, or mentorship might leave me just as lost five years later, only now with wasted time and a weak foundation. I’m not a genius. I won’t magically make it on talent alone. That’s why I’m trying to bet on something that’ll actually prepare me for the world.

But now the second wall. I have no income, no high income skills, and OCD that messes with my focus, energy, and consistency. Even simple tasks spiral into mental battles. Time slips, motivation dips, and I feel like I’m just trying to keep my head above water.

I do have a basic laptop (4GB RAM, 256 SSD), and I’ve tried everything people online recommend  microtasks, surveys, GPT sites, mobile apps  but either they don’t work in India or they pay peanuts after hours of effort.

It’s now July. CLAT is in December. I need time to prep, stay mentally stable, and also find some income stream, even if it’s ₹500 to ₹1,000 per week. Something real. Something that gives me momentum.

But everywhere I look, people assume you already have something  capital, contacts, talent, time. I have none of that. Just a window, and if I miss this, I don’t know when I’ll get another.

If you’ve been here, truly from zero, how did you start?
What’s the first thing someone like me can do to slowly, realistically, start building income, skills, or direction?

Please skip the ""just learn coding"" or ""start a YouTube channel"" answers unless you know how someone like me, without money, mental bandwidth, or connections, can actually do that.

I don’t want fake hope. I want practical direction. Even if it’s small. Even if it’s ugly.

I know some of what she said is true. But I have spent the last decades of my life taken care of my parents. Dad passed in late 2019, and it's been Mom and I ever since. She currently has neuropathy and lymphoma and is beginning with very light dementia.  I am responsible for pretty much everything. We do live in  poverty or close to it; I've never checked. 

Despite what our neighbor said, I/we have tried to fix what she's complaining about. Last year we were scammed out of $7k+, for example, trying to do just that, for the umpteenth time.  I have begged and pleaded multiple people multiple times for help with cleaning, both here and my grandparents old house, bought by Mom & Dad from Grandpa before he passed. No every time. 

We should be hearing from the scheduler at the hospital soon for Mom. 

I usually feel down and overwhelmed and hopeless, those wotfd bidn't help any. I'm not suicidal, but I could get there. I talked to someone earlier this week about groups and events I might try out.  

I know we need to have more income coming in. I know prices are going up. I know we need to eat better, and so on. We have insurance and taxes coming up, etc. We need security here. We need yard work, but I also need to take care of Mom. She's not that bad yet, but I drive her back and forth as we, no real alt transportation at this time. 

I'm at the end of my rope. We have cut back. We eat very cheap food, which really isn't good for her, too much sodium. We don't get clothes, even 2nd hand, very oftren. We can't even afford the $75 annual library card.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

How do I protect my emotional space while still living with her? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of complicated parent relationship while grieving? I am so grateful for any advice.

It can be challenging to navigate emotional situations, especially when dealing with a family member.

You might find it helpful to schedule regular check-ins or designate a specific time each day to talk, rather than having spontaneous conversations that may not be met with understanding.

Hey everyone!  
I’ve been training a **Recurrent PPO** agent to play the classic **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Arcade)** game using only visual input. The goal is to teach the agent to fight through the levels using memory and spatial awareness, just like a human would.

Here are some key details:

* **Environment:** TMNT Arcade via custom Gymnasium + stable-retro integration
* **Observations:** 4 stacked grayscale frames at **160×160** resolution
* **Augmentations:** Random noise, brightness shifts, and cropping to improve generalization
* **Reward Signal:** Based on score increase, boss damage, and stage progression
* **Algorithm:** Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (RecPPO) with CNN + LSTM
* **Framework:** PyTorch with custom training loop (inspired by SB3)

The recurrent architecture has made a big difference in stability and long-term decision making. The agent is now able to consistently beat the first few levels and is learning to prioritize enemies and avoid damage.","That's an impressive project you've got going there! I'm curious, have you considered exploring different observation sizes or types to see if they have any impact on the agent's performance? For instance, using higher resolution frames or adding color information could potentially enhance its ability to recognize enemies and navigate through the levels more effectively. Or, you could experiment with different augmentations to further improve generalization. Keep up the great work!",neutral

"Hi all, sad to be part of this group. 

My father is progressing quickly. Went from mild cognitive impairment to disorganized thinking within a short time, mostly due to a viral infection and a couple of life changes.

He may be entering the mild dementia stage soon but as someone who is very particular it is going to be torture on my mother (who still works) to somehow be 24/7 care.

1) is it too early to be looking for memory care for someone who may not even qualify as dementia?

2) Can anyone recommmend a good facility in NJ?

3) What bridges the gap between the slow, grinding daily indignity of this disease and the need for memory care. ","I'm sorry to hear about your father's health and the challenges your family is facing. Regarding your questions:

1. The decision to seek memory care depends on various factors, including the severity of your father's condition, the resources available for at-home care, and your mother's ability to handle the caregiving responsibilities. It's essential to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of both options - in-home care and memory care facilities. In-home care can provide more personalized attention and familiar surroundings, but it may also require a more significant time commitment and emotional toll on your mother.

"I am writing this to just share what I have still in my heart. 

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down. Anyways, I was a fighter and got to know that it has higher chances of survival so I fought and finally I won Cancer in Dec if 2018 itself. Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it. 

So, now while I have recovered and doing all well, It broke me. My mind is not as sharp as it was. I am always angry, frustrated, mean and need support for decisions. It broke me! I am not what I was earlier and may never be.

"So I was rear ended in Feb of 2024, my lawyer called today and said he was able to settle and I will be receiving about 20k in pain and suffering damages.

"My partner and i have been dealing with Long Covid for 3.5 years, i developed it, a seriously broken immune system as well as CFS amongst 80 other symptoms ... she felt helpless.

**I know it has been difficult for her, she voiced this and we always sat down and spoke about everything in a safe space, at the very start she wanted to walk away "" How is our life going to look if you cant get better ? ""**

**I completely understand, chronic illness is a life sentence in most cases ... you have to adapt and accept your life will change, maybe she couldnt.**

**I said "" if it doesnt get better in 2 years i will walk away , it wouldnt be fair for you to be stuck to a sick man for life ""**

**Whenever she had difficulties with it we would sit and talk, understandably for the first year we spent very little time together, my suffering was immense it was all i could do to just stay alive ... after that though i made the effort needed to still spend time together regardless of how shit i felt, board game nights, movie nights, cooking nights, walking outside as much as i could with CFS, picnics by the lake. Pushing myself to limits that i shouldnt have and that often really pushed my baseline back.**

**I was there for her through this whole thing, when i should have been there for myself. All i ever wanted was for her to be happy, safe and loved. It was always my number 1 priority.**

Before the illness we climbed mountains, wild camped, constantly outdoors together. We started healing our past traumas, working on real growth, planning the future, i even started learning her language.

We had our difficulties like everybody else but there was real love there ... Don't get me wrong i understand it wasn't easy, our life became difficult overnight, we could no longer socialise and do things as a couple. Even catching a flu could have had serious consequences, for the first year i was unable to breath, walk or talk without great difficulty ... doctors could not help me - they said and i quote ..

**"" We know what it is we just dont know why it happens so we can't help you, all you can do is go home and hope it gets better ""**

After that i knew i was on my own and refused to just roll over and die, i spent countless hours researching everything i could get my hands on all while suffering the most immense symptoms, we counted 80 at one point. Honestly i made sure it impacted on her life as little as possible, still financially payed my half ... still dragged my broken body out into nature when i could, cleaning when i couldnt breath and struggled to walk.

I encouraged her regularly to go out and enjoy life, grow and go on holiday with friends, i would catch up when my illness was better. I even supported her financially when i really couldnt. I know it was hard for her and i know she developed depression. I started to get therapy for my worries about my illness and the future and encouraged her to speak to someone as well.. she never did.

**The thing is there was 0 Caregiving At least not in the sense you think, i wouldnt allow it ... i needed it, by god i needed it but i couldn't let it disrupt our lives more than it already had.**

**I struggled to cook and feed myself - i did it anyway.**

**I struggled to shower or bath - i did it anyway.**

**I struggled to walk - i pushed myself anyway, relearning how to walk.**

**I struggled to talk or form words - i relearned myself.**

**I struggled financially - i payed my side of everything through the whole situation, i never allowed her to support me financially.**

The only thing i ever needed for her was to pick up a few things in town that i couldnt get delievered once a month.

3.5 years in i am 85% better and looking at real remission next year.

**Our lives were back to a semi social state, our sex life was in full swing, i was starting to make serious plans for next year in regards to our lives.**

**Heres the kicker, she went away to a retreat the other week and took a hefty dose of mushrooms..** Before she left she was this incredibly sweet, loving, caring partner that had light in her eyes, all in all the woman i knew and loved.

**She came back the total opposite .. Cold, Never sat down, Always on the go, i quite literally saw her for maybe 3 hours in 2 weeks before she went on her next holiday .. almost 0 empathy, for us .. The light in her eyes had just gone.**

She apparently met someone at this retreat and felt things for them, they got close. I have no idea how close, she said they just shared some hugs and talks about how they feel things for each other, then they were messaging after the retreat .. which seems like madness to me ... she was there for 7 days compared to our 7 years.

She said that was the catalyst for her, she had cheated on her past partner a few times and felt that at that point if she was feeling something for someone else something had changed, she asked for an open relationship when she got back ... **she said she could stay with me if she could meet with this other person and do the things our life was lacking socially. She said "" I know if i spend time with this person i will explore it on a physical level also and i want to ""**

**I was honestly shocked and horrified ... wtf happened to the woman i love ???**

I wasn't ok with that, i honestly considered it just before she left for her holiday last week then she completely did a 180 and said actually no i need to find myself... It was a huge head fuck ...

She told me she wanted to leave and that she had lost herself. I asked if she would like to take one of our walks by the river before she goes on holiday and we could talk ... We had a talk about everything and at the end of it i asked..

**"" If we try and make it work - would you be by my side if i get sick again ? ""**

**She said**

**"" No ""**

**That was it ... 0 reaction ... just No - Before this she would say things like**

**"" We will get through this "" - "" I'm here for you "" - "" Like you always say take it day by day ""**

I understand chronic illness is difficult for everyone not just the sufferer, i saw the effect it had on her and tried to help as much as possible ... reassuring i was doing everything i could .. showing her the real improvement. Things were getting back to normal for us.

I adore her completely .. she was the woman i was going to spend my life with.

Maybe i am naive - Maybe i just couldnt see how much it was getting to her. If thats the case and she ever reads this ... I'm so sorry i couldn't see.

Maybe she truly felt that way and the mushrooms just unblocked her walls .. All i know is she changed so quickly, she went from my partner to a Cold total stranger in a matter of days.

I will always be here friend ... no matter how far we drift she will always have support from me whenever she needs it ... i may have lost her as a partner but i never want to lose her as a friend.

I hope she finds happiness in life, truly i do ... i hope she finds what she couldnt find here.

"look i'm not a therapist or anything, just figured out something that helped my mental health and maybe it'll help someone else. If this sounds dumb, it probably is and sorry in advance.

I used to think being accountable to myself meant being harsh. like if i wasn't being ""productive"" or doing well mentally, i needed to track everything and push harder. but that just made me feel worse about myself most of the time.

the problem was tracking the wrong things. I was obsessing over streaks and consistency instead of paying attention to how things actually made me feel like for example i'd force myself to meditate for 20 minutes daily to keep my streak alive even when 5 minutes felt better. or i'd scroll social media then beat myself up about it instead of understanding why i was doing it.

So i switched it up to tracking three simple things for activities that are supposed to help my mental health: how calm i feel (1-10), how present I was (1-10), and how ready i feel to tackle things (1-10). that's it. no streaks, no guilt if i miss days.

what i love is it's not about being perfect instead it's about being curious. some days i take great breaks and feel amazing. other days i doom-scroll for 20 minutes and rate it a 2 for restoration. both are valuable because they build self-awareness about what actually helps my mental state versus what i think should help.

the funny thing is understanding my patterns without judgment made me naturally choose better habits. when you see that 10-minute walks consistently rate 8/10 but scrolling rates 3/10, the choice becomes obvious.

Being kind to yourself doesn't mean giving up on self-care, it means building awareness about what actually helps your mental health and choosing those things more often. Try rating how you feel after different activities tomorrow. just awareness, no judgment. it's been a game changer for my mental health.","I'm intrigued by your approach to self-care and mental health tracking.

I live in what used to be my grandmother‘s house. When she passed away in 2022, it became my uncle Butch’s house. I live here along with my uncle Roger, and we both paid him five dollars for a five year lease a year after grandma died.

On June 9, Roger assaulted me, resulting in a busted lip, bruises, cuts, and a broken nose. I then called the police and he was later arrested. I called Butch to tell him about this and he said that if Roger has to move out as a result of this, I have to move out too. He, along with everyone else in my family, are mad at me for calling the cops on Roger, just because he’s “family,” and trying to claim that I started it and touched him first, which was not true. Roger pressed his body up against me and pushed me into a wall and I pushed him to get him off of me.

Weeks later, my cousin Jase who’s 13, came to the house unannounced… again, and crawled through the doggy door since the doors were locked, again.

I told him and his mom that if people were so worried about my well-being, they could call the police and do a wellness check if they wanted to. Also, I told his mom that Jase doing this could be considered breaking and entering/unlawful entry, and this made her so mad that she called Butch and told him. (Jase already has a vandalism charge on him for breaking a teacher’s laptop, fyi.)

Butch came by later and said that if he ever got word the police were at the house for something as stupid as a wellness check, “things will be changing around here pretty damn fast.” He also told me not to get mad at Jase for crawling through the doggy door for ANY reason.

Now Butch is withholding my lease from me. I had asked him for a new copy since I misplaced my old one.

"Edit 2: Reading the responses, I feel like I'm forced to choose between love and being financially responsible.

----------

Edit: Woke up to a bunch of comments and I responded to a lot of them. How are people dating with just a couple hundred left over each month? Especially when the man is expected to pay for the majority of dates?

Also with the women I've entered into a relationship with, the majority were expecting me to own my home, not rent.

-------------

For the women of Reddit, how important is it for the man you're dating to have his own home? I've been told by my friends and family members that one of the reasons I'm not making much dating progress is because I'm a 33 year old, East Asian (Canadian Born Chinese) male who currently lives at home with his mom. It seems that for the majority of the women I date, whether first dates or in a relationship with, the moment they hear this, they instantly lose interest. Or in the case of one of my past relationships, she said I needed to move out within 3 months of going official or she'd break up with me.

It's not that I don't want to move out. Nor am I your stereotypical guy living at home in his mom's basement. I contribute around the house and pay rent. But financially speaking, it's near impossible for me to move out. I take home over $4k/month and I still don't have sufficient down payment to buy a condo unless I borrow over $100k from my mom because I can get only about a $300k mortgage loan @ \~4%. For reference, a good 1+1 bedroom condo with parking costs about $530k in my city. After paying all expenses and the mortgage, I'd have about $500 left each month. If I rented, the amount left increases slightly to about $1,000 each month. With either option, I'd become financially stressed and would have a very difficult time saving. I'm not a fan of living with roommates either, especially since I'd be confined to my room when I have the house to myself right now. I'm fairly independent and short of taking women home for a night of fun, I can pretty much do whatever I want.
","I understand the financial challenges you're facing and the impact it has on your dating life. Have you considered exploring other housing options, such as a smaller condo or townhouse, that may be more affordable and could help you build equity towards owning a home in the future? Additionally, have you looked into government programs or assistance for first-time homebuyers or low-income individuals? It's important to prioritize your financial stability and long-term goals while also considering the expectations of potential partners.

"Location: Florida

Yesterday, I met someone to give them a dog I've been trying to rehome. Things went well, and she seemed to like the dog and decided to move forward. She had a friend there that was a bit sketchy. All the info she had of me was an email, and my middle name. We emailed afterwards answering a couple questions: when's his birthday, how much to feed him, etc. Fast forward to today, I checked my email and there was nothing so I assumed she was doing good with the dog. I laid down to take a nap(we have a newborn), and was woken up by my wife saying two women were beating on our door. I was a bit disoriented(you know when you get woken up abruptly), and checked the nest. It was her. I was confused, we met at another location, and she had no info about me. I didn't answer, she told the nest camera she wanted to give the dog back. Then they left.

In the span of about 15 min, they leave messages on both mine and my wife's phones(numbers I didn't give them), and show up my work demanding I take the dog back(I'm on vacation). At this point I'm still confused and a little angry lol. I'm pretty non confrontational and at the same time my brother showed up. Half of me just wanted to call them back and just go get the dog, but the other half of me want nothing to do with people that show up to my job uninvited, much less my home. Before I could think through it, my brother texted and said it he was house sitting and that we were out of town lol, and that it was inappropriate that they showed up to my work. She texted back saying she doesn't want the dog because she's going to lose her apartment if she keeps it.

Is it kind of psycho that they tracked me down, found my job, and then showed up unannounced, or am I being paranoid? I gave them a bunch of dog stuff and dog food. I think one of the boxes had a address label on it and that's how they got it, but I'm not sure.

After that relapse of drinking, I felt bad of course for resetting my date but then I started feeling good about the program. I was feeling optimistic and felt hopeful. All of a sudden, last Tuesday, depression hit me like I ran full speed into a brick wall. It was so bad I was really contemplating suicide but I was able to call my sponsor and message other friends. Prior to this I had made a psych appointment to go over medication options if needed. I was just depressed, angry, irritated and tired. I went over my history and recent events with her. She used the word bipolar but diagnosed me with a working diagnosis of unspecified mood disorder. I have ADHD as well. She gave me gabapentin and Lamotrigine.

It's only 25mg for now until 2 weeks I switch to 50mg for 2 weeks and then follow up with her granted there's no major side effects before going to 100mg.

"As you can read from the title, I’ve just finished up my 14th cycle of chemo after recurrence back in November last year. I have done 28 days of radiation and did a pet scan this week so that my doctors can discuss a possible surgery to my spine. It has been a very hard year, and I’m so glad it’s over. However, it’s hitting me in ways that I didn’t expect. 

On my first cycle, I stayed overnight in hospital and I ended up sharing a room with someone who was my age and we both had Ewings. We immediately connected, shared contact info and the rest was history. She was on her first cycle also, so it felt as though we were fighting this thing together as a team. We would share stories about what our days or weeks had been like, any funny stories while we were in the oncology ward, always making sure to visit each others rooms if we were in the ward at the same time. As someone who has had Ewings before, I was able to answer any and all questions she’d have about treatment and hopefully alleviate her anxiety - of which she had a lot. So yeah, we were fighting this thing together and although I would never wish this on anyone, I was glad to have her by my side through this fight. I considered her a very good friend.

Unfortunately, she stopped responding to treatment and passed away around our 10th cycle. I was, and still am, a complete mess. My last 4 cycles of chemo dragged on and felt never ending. Now that it’s finished, I can’t stop crying. I keep thinking about her and how she should be here with me now, celebrating the end of chemo. 

I feel so so exhausted now, everything hit me like a truck now that I’ve finished chemo. Throughout treatment, I kept on working full time, using leave for whenever I was not up for work - typically while I was doing chemo (I wfh for reference). Now that treatment is over, I’m expected to be back at work 40 hours every week and I just don’t know how I can do it. I pushed myself so hard to continue work throughout treatment and now that it’s over I just have to keep going. My ‘prize’ for finishing chemo is more work? I’m scared to leave my job because the job market is so bad right now and I hear stories from everywhere about people not being able to find jobs. I don’t know what to do but I’m not sure I can go on like this. 

Not sure if this sounds entitled but I really don’t want to work, at least right now. I want to go traveling and have new experiences, I feel like I deserve to do this? I might die anyways, I don’t want to be working in my final year of life.

"I Spent a lot of time digging into the science behind habits and motivation. Thought I’d share what actually helps people stay consistent:

1. **Progress is the best motivation.** You think you need motivation to start. In reality, you need visible progress to keep going. When you can see that something is working, you want to keep showing up. Think about it. First week in the gym, you're making beginner gains. Reading daily? You feel smarter fast. That early progress pulls you in. But when it slows down, your drive fades. That's when most people quit. James Clear said it best: “The best form of motivation is progress”. This doesn’t have to be complicated. Move paper clips from one pile to another. Tick a to-do list. Use an app. If you’re not tracking it, you’re not feeling it.
2. **Streaks give you something to lose.** When you're building a habit, the hardest part is showing up on the days you don't feel like it. A streak helps with that. It turns a habit into something you're not just building, but protecting. You hit day seven and day eight matters more. Your brain starts seeing the chain, and not breaking it becomes the new goal. It’s simple, but powerful. This is why language apps, fitness trackers, and even snapchat use it. Once you’ve got momentum, consistency stops being a decision and starts being automatic.
3. **Motivation fades. Identity doesn’t.** Telling yourself “I want to work out” works for a little while. But saying “I’m the kind of person who trains” sticks. That shift from action to identity is what makes a habit last. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits: true behaviour change is identity change. When you start acting like the person you want to become, the habit becomes part of your self-image. And once it’s tied to who you are, skipping it feels off. You don’t need constant motivation if the habit reinforces how you see yourself.
4. **You’re not lazy. You just lack structure.** Most people think they have a motivation problem, but what they really have is a systems problem. You’re not broken. You’re just trying to rely on willpower in an environment built for distraction. Setting goals feels productive, but goals don’t get you through hard days. Systems do. A goal might tell you where you want to go, but a system tells you what to do today. James Clear puts it clearly in Atomic Habits: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Without structure, your brain defaults to whatever is easiest. That’s not laziness, that’s efficiency. Build systems that guide your day. Waking up earlier, sleeping on time, knowing what task comes next. Whether that’s a planner, a checklist, or an app that takes the thinking out of it, structure is what makes consistency possible.
5. **Your environment beats your willpower.** You don’t skip your habits because you’re weak. You skip them because your setup makes the wrong choice easier. If your phone is right next to you, you’re going to pick it up. If junk food is on the counter, you’re going to eat it. Research from Wendy Wood shows that most of our daily actions are driven by environment and habit, not conscious decision. Willpower is unreliable. Design your space so good choices are the default, not the fight. If your phone is distracting you, put it in another room or use an app blocker. Make the right thing easier and the wrong thing harder.
6. **Reward matters more than you think.** You won’t stick with a habit if it only feels like effort. Your brain needs a reason to come back. That reason is reward. Not in a year, but today. You need a positive feedback loop. Something that tells your brain, “this is working, do it again.” Studies in neuroscience show that dopamine doesn’t just respond to pleasure. It responds to anticipated reward. When the brain expects a payoff, it is more likely to repeat the behaviour. A 1997 paper by Schultz et al. found that dopamine spikes when we predict a reward, not just when we receive one. This is why gamification works. Progress bars, streaks, and small visible wins give your brain a reason to keep going. Make the habit feel rewarding now, and it becomes easier to repeat tomorrow.

I hope this helps. If you’re serious about changing things, this is where it starts.","That's an insightful post about the science behind habits and motivation. I've heard of the importance of tracking progress and building streaks, but I'd love to know more about the role of identity in forming habits.

Additionally, have there been any studies on the effectiveness of different reward systems in reinforcing habits? I'm curious to learn more about the neuroscience behind this topic.",neutral

"Location: Illinois


My dad married his ex-wife when I was 17. She was a stereotypical people-user and she told my mom, in front of me, that she taught her daughters you marry for money not love. Dear dad didn't get the memo. He said he made her sign a pre-nup so he thought he was golden and she was so perfect and blah blah blah. She turned him against my sisters and I to the point we really didn't have a relationship for ~13 years, until she filed for divorce and got around the prenup. He said there's a law that let's your spouse work around the prenuptial after 14 years. I don't know. She took everything from him including the inheritance my grandmother left entirely to him with a verbal instruction to divide amongst me and my sisters/his half siblings. Spoilers alert, he kept everything and then shared it with his wife and left my sisters and I to struggle and figure things out on our own. Which we did, but it wasn't easy. 


When they divorced my father also had gotten an Alzheimers diagnosis. When we started trying to help take care of him (begrudgingly on my part, willingly on my sister's) he swore he had taken care of fixing the will. He wasn't too far gone in the diagnosis yet, so we thought he did. Hindsight is 20-20.


My dad passed away a few months ago. My sister has been in charge of his estate and she found out the hard way that my dad never updated his will. The will that he had filled out most recently was thankfully voided because it left 1/3 of the estate to me and everything else to his ex wife. The new one has 1/3 to me, 1/3 to one sister and 1/3 to a 3rd party that won't be revealed to us but no one else in our family has come forth with it, including 2 half sisters who called Just to see if they were the 3rd beneficiary. They were not. Which leads us to ex wife. 


The inheritance is small for us, around $8000 a piece. His pension however is not being given to either of us. I don't know anything about estate law. My father worked for the state and I've been told his pension is like ~$100k. Is there any standing we would have to contest this? I don't even necessarily want the money though of course it would help. But that woman has stolen so much from our family, including the relationship with our dad. She doesn't deserve this.


Thank you.","I'm sorry to hear about the complicated situation you and your family are going through. It's important to clarify a few things before discussing the pension issue.

First, I'd like to ask if you have any information about the specific terms of your father's prenuptial agreement? This could potentially impact the distribution of assets, including the pension. Also, have you consulted with an estate lawyer or a legal professional to understand the laws regarding pension distributions in Illinois and the specifics of your father's employment?

"I took a *totally mutual* break with my hs sweetheart (got dumped), after 6 months of wallowing, I decided my self esteem wasn't low enough and downloaded tinder to meet someone. Finally matched with someone way out of my league, and somehow we were actually vibin. Then her replies started slowing down, np I'm confident, 1 hour goes by, little worried, 2 hours… my brain went full **meltdown** mode.

I panicked, and a couple hours later sent a message that I convinced myself was confident (it wasn't), '*hey enjoying this convo, let's meet in town and i'll buy us some food :)*', she said, '*id prefer to keep talking here for a bit first*'. Couple dead replies later I got unmatched. **ahh rejection**, how can something i know so well, hit my fkn core every single time.

What i know now, that i wish i knew then... **METACOGNITION**, otherwise known as **thinking about thinking**.

**Event:** Slow replies  
**Feeling:** Fear  
**My explanation:** Losing interest  
**Action:** She's pulling away I need to save it.

When her replies slowed down, I thought to myself, 'I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE!', it's happened 1 million times before, at that point i may as well take drastic measures to meet, cos the ships sinking. Not realising, my inability to handle that panic, and just **let it pass**, was probably the VERY thing that she picked up as weird.

I thought that BECAUSE she lost interest, that's why I felt fear. If I just had awareness I'd have realised that the **fear came first**, and that **influenced** my explanation, and therefore my action. 

Which brings me to, wtf do i do about this? **Awareness.**

All you have to do, to overcome this is be aware that panic sits inside you. Nothing else, no breathing, no course, no gym. Just be aware and you'll be more free to move forward, without the chains of your past.

"I was diagnosed probably 2 years ago and started taking meds immediately. I also do a lot of independent research so I can fully understand all of my symptoms. Lately, I have been feeling like my ADHD paralysis has gotten worse. It's really only on the days where I take a break from my meds.

"I have surgery in a month and I know my needs won’t be taken seriously. Whenever I say I have “ME/CFS” doctors have no idea what I’m talking about so I have to resort to calling it “chronic fatigue syndrome” which pains me. Sounds like such a whiny condition for something with one of the worst QOL. My surgeon and anesthesiologist have probably only dealt with a single digit number of people with ME/CFS and they’ve probably all been more mild than me so probably didn’t require as many accommodations as me. They’re gonna be thinking “Why does this girl need all this just because she has fatigue?” 

In my chart, despite saying I had “chronic fatigue syndrome”, they only documented POTS and long COVID. Completely erased the ME/CFS aspect. Long COVID as a diagnosis is also terrible since it’s not only controversial and subject to be mocked by covid deniers, but it’s an umbrella term. People think it’s either a loss of smell or lung issues (I’ve had medical staff refer to it as “lung covid”). They’re gonna wonder why that’s relevant in a surgical context. 

The only diagnosis that saves me is POTS, believe it or not. Most of my doctors recognize it as a real condition and due to the effects on the heart and blood vessels, it is taken more seriously in a surgical setting. But again, the name makes it sound so unserious unless you spell it out as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. And it doesn’t help that I’m a young woman so they probably think I’m making my health issues my entire personality to be difficult, and for some reason POTS is one of those conditions associated with malingering.

"A few weeks ago, I made a decision at work that I thought was the right thing to do, but it’s honestly left me feeling kind of isolated and second-guessing myself.

I’ve been at my company for 6 years. Things are stable, I’m doing okay financially, and I’m not in a rush to climb the corporate ladder. Recently, I was offered a promotion to a team lead position. It came with a raise and more responsibility. I was flattered, but I wasn’t super excited about it. I don’t have any financial pressures, and to be honest, the role wasn’t something I was dying to take.

Around the same time, a coworker of mine (let’s call her Sarah) was also in the running. She’s a single mom, and her young son has had serious medical issues over the past year. She’s been under a ton of stress, and even with everything going on, she’s been a rockstar at work. She’s incredibly competent, thoughtful, and honestly deserved the position just as much as I did.

So after thinking it over, I went to my manager and declined the offer. I didn’t make a big thing of it, just said I appreciated the opportunity but wasn’t ready to take on the role, and that I thought Sarah would be a great choice. She ended up getting it, and she was so grateful. I didn’t tell her why I declined, I didn’t want her to feel weird about it.

But now word has gotten around the office (not sure how, I never said anything), and I’m hearing that some people are saying I did it just to look good. A couple coworkers even said it was “manipulative” and that I made everyone else look bad for accepting promotions in the past. One person told me I was trying to play the “office martyr.”

That stung. I wasn’t trying to prove anything or get praise. I just figured, if someone else needed the opportunity more than I did, why not let them have it? But now I feel kind of dumb, like I made things more complicated than they needed to be. I didn’t expect backlash for trying to do something kind.

"I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, if it isn’t feel free to take down or point me in the right direction!! 

I have done cocaine 4-5 times. At home with my boyfriend, at shows, on trips with people. The last time I did it was probably 2 lines in April ish at a show. 

Lately I have been craving a bump. It is a high that is unmatched and is just so enjoyable and fun. Feeling that happy… there’s nothing like it. I have been stressed from lots of change in my life this year. I have struggled with depression/anxiety and just going through the motions of life. Are my cravings and my struggles linked? How can I suddenly crave and think about a substance I have not touched in months? Is this a sign of addiction or something bigger? 

Not sure if this matters but I’m 21, have no personal history of substance abuse. I smoke weed 1-3 times a week. I enjoy a cocktail, I don’t love getting drunk. I’ve dabbled in various drugs but usually have anxiety as a side effect that ruined it for me. Definitely have family history of substance abuse. ","It's interesting to consider the potential connection between your recent cravings for cocaine and the stressors you've experienced in your life this year. Research suggests that stress can increase the desire for drugs, even among those with no prior substance abuse history. However, it's important to note that cravings alone do not necessarily indicate addiction. The concept of addiction is complex and influenced by both biological and environmental factors. Have you tried exploring other coping mechanisms for managing stress and anxiety, such as meditation, exercise, or therapy? These practices can help improve overall mental health and well-being, potentially reducing the need for substances to feel good. Additionally, speaking with a healthcare professional or substance abuse counselor could provide valuable insight",neutral
"EDIT - we met up this morning and he ended it. He said he’s told me a million times that he is secular and that the main reason that “tipped him over the edge” was the fact that I have been making out that he is lying. I was gobsmacked and asked him why this is and he said that he has explained his religion vs traditional culture to me many times and that because I “keep asking him about it” it makes him think that there is no trust. I told him that that is not the case at all and that whilst I remember bits of what he’s told me about his tradition and his views there has never been any conversation about what he expects from myself. I also reminded him that a few weeks ago I proactively brought it up and said that I wanted to understand it more (when we were chilling and watching TV) and he said he was too tired to chat about it. He responded by saying that that is beside the point… he then walked off. 😔😔😔


We’ve been dating for 6 months now (I’m 36f and he’s 38m) and everything had been going great. We have had little disagreements but they’ve been dealt with in an emotionally mature way. I love this man so much and honestly thought he was/is the one so I feel heartbroken and torn apart . 

I attended a Sunday dinner at my boyfriend’s auntie’s house last week and felt confused and out of place because I was the only non-Christian attendee. My boyfriend told me that it would be a religious affair and that there would be singing. I assumed that it would be fun singing but instead it was incredibly formal and more like hymns. 

I called him this morning to talk through the dinner from last Sunday because I was still mulling it over. He tells me he’s not religious but then he knew all the prayers by heart, so I’m confused. During the phone call I start asking him questions about it and I tell him that I’m confused. He reacts badly and says that this conversation is weird. I reiterated that I didn’t have a bad time at the thinner but that it was way more formal than I thought it would be and I did express some concerns about my role in this. Would I be expected to go to these dinners on a regular basis? Do I need to know the hyms? Etc et  

Fast forward 6 hours, he texts me and I can tell he is super pissed off, he is saying that he is not religious but practices the traditions and that he feels like I misinterpreted him and his family and he feels disrespected. I explain that I am not trying to poke him but instead I’m wanting to learn about it so that I can take things on board for our future. I also told him that I flew to the Middle East years ago to work for a Christian aid think tank… So I am definitely not opposed to the religion. And I was still so confused as to Why has he taken this the wrong way?? I’m confused about the distinction between what is a tradition and what is religion and what role (if any I would I’ve to play).  The only thing that I specifically thought we had discussed is having our children baptised but he said this would be a tradition which I agreed with. 

He then started to get angry and said “I am not a religious Christian who is practising but I was born one. And the fact that I am having to convince you that I am not Christian is weird and unacceptable and I will never justify myself to anyone. My family are my world and you have issues with them. I am appalled that I asked you to be my girlfriend. I couldn’t care about religion but this is my culture and I won’t tolerate being interrogated by you ever again. We can chat tomorrow”. 

Any advice on how I navigate this? I genuinely want to understand and support him but he’s taken my questions as disrespect. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations where your partner identifies with a religion culturally but claims not to be religious? How do I approach this without him feeling attacked? And did my actions warrant his angry reaction? 😫😫😫

Edit: Something I just remembered, he has been working flat out for most of our relationship and has a new job in accounting. He has told me numerous times that at this moment in time (over the next 6 months or so), he has de-prioritised social events with friends but still made time to see me. He said that once his probation ends he will become more “normal” with his work life balance. So I think what I was trying to get at is how often would 
 I have to attend these things when his work has calmed down as last night was the first time. I did not communicate that to him btw which I should have done 

Also an example of our past disagreements… he has loads of photos on Facebook of him with loads of girls out partying (these photos are months apart and not every weekend). And in about 7/8 photos he has his arms wrapped around girls with them kissing his cheeks. In the first month of us dating I showed my friend his Facebook and she saw all of the photos, and said that he looks like a player. Prior to this I had only seen two of these types of photos and had not done a detailed look at his FB like my friend so I had a wierd feeling about it. I called him up a few hours later when she’d gone and asked him about it calmly. I remember saying that I want to understand why these photos are there because it infers that you’re not after a relationship? I also followed up with that I get the opposite impression from you in real life so it’s confusing for me. He got very very defensive and said that he can have any photos that he wants on social media etc etc and that I should trust him for who he is in person. I can’t exactly remember how the conversation ended but he reassured me that he doesn’t want a casual fling. So maybe this is contributing to how he’s feeling now ","I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're in, OP. It seems like there's a lot of confusion surrounding your boyfriend's religious beliefs and traditions. I can understand why you might feel the need to ask questions to better understand the situation, but it's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own beliefs and cultural practices. Perhaps you could try having an open and respectful conversation with your boyfriend about his feelings and concerns. You could ask him to explain the distinction between his religious beliefs and cultural traditions, and ask if there are any expectations for you to participate in religious or cultural practices in the future.

"I (29M) turned 29 yesterday. No calls. No texts. Not even a Facebook notification. I knew I probably wouldn’t hear from anyone, my family and I are estranged, I lost touch with friends during the pandemic, and my job is remote. I didn’t expect much.

But still… it stung.

So I walked to the bakery and bought a small cake. Chocolate with blue icing. I asked them to write “Happy Birthday, James!” on it. When they asked if it was for a kid or an adult, I smiled and lied, said, “Oh, it’s for my little cousin.”

I brought it home, lit a candle, and sang the song quietly to myself. I took a picture of it, posted it to my private Instagram like someone else had bought it for me. Just so it wouldn’t look so lonely.

It’s dumb, I know. But I needed it to feel like someone remembered me.

I didn’t even eat much of the cake. I just sat there and thought about how life kind of drifts when no one’s around to anchor it.

Anyway. Happy birthday to me, I guess.","Have you considered reaching out to your family or friends to let them know how you're feeling and maybe arrange a virtual celebration?

"Location: Oregon 
Hi everyone! I have a legal question, but some background first: my husband and I purchased a home in the Portland Oregon area almost exactly a year ago, which has 5 mature, very beautiful, extremely tall Douglas Firs in the backyard. We were told by our neighbors that the newer houses that abut the back of our property used to all be a Douglas Fir grove, but about 5 years ago, a housing development razed all of the beautiful and historic trees (all of them, didn’t leave a single one standing) to build the houses.

One of the Firs looks a bit sad to me so we had an experienced arborist come assess. They said that it is in decline and we will need to pay to have it removed (the other 4 are doing fine for now). Because there is no longer any safe space to fell the tree, the quote is $16,000 for this work. The arborist said this tree has been slowly dying because the housing development chopped the rest of the grove that was once next to it (on the other side of our property) and destroyed a large part the tree’s root system.

So now to my legal question: can the housing development or HOA be at all held responsible for the death of our tree - albeit somewhat delayed after they removed the rest of the grove? $16,000 is a lot of money and we wouldn’t be out this money if they had built around the Firs (or at least some of them) as our streets houses did back in the early 00’s.","I'm sorry to hear about your struggling tree and the high cost of removal. It's unfortunate that the housing development didn't preserve the Douglas Fir grove when building. Have you considered reaching out to a local environmental lawyer or advocacy group for advice?

Hey everyone!  
I’ve been training a **Recurrent PPO** agent to play the classic **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Arcade)** game using only visual input. The goal is to teach the agent to fight through the levels using memory and spatial awareness, just like a human would.

Here are some key details:

* **Environment:** TMNT Arcade via custom Gymnasium + stable-retro integration
* **Observations:** 4 stacked grayscale frames at **160×160** resolution
* **Augmentations:** Random noise, brightness shifts, and cropping to improve generalization
* **Reward Signal:** Based on score increase, boss damage, and stage progression
* **Algorithm:** Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (RecPPO) with CNN + LSTM
* **Framework:** PyTorch with custom training loop (inspired by SB3)

The recurrent architecture has made a big difference in stability and long-term decision making. The agent is now able to consistently beat the first few levels and is learning to prioritize enemies and avoid damage.","That's an impressive project you've got going there!

His second daughter, DNA has never been done but the mother swears the child is his. In 2021 after Covid was fading out she randomly messages him after finding out he is with me. Mind you the child is now 4. She is demanding he send money for this and that, I told him if she wanted to go through the courts we would pay for the DNA. I see it as if it’s your child you should man up and do what’s right. She declined almost instantly. She said she would just go to the courts and have him called in. Well fast forward to 2023 and we didn’t hear anything from the courts. I decided to look up online and see she is doing paternity for this child but with a man of her other 2 kids. Fast forward to 2024 still haven’t heard anything and decided to check again only to see that this child has the same last name as the man for her other 2 kids. I feel it’s important to note that this man that she brought in for paternity was there the day the child was born that she is accusing my fiancé of being the father of. Also to add he signed the birth certificate for her in the hospital. Fast forward to 2025 she has message family trying to start it all back up. So now my questions?

Should we petition court for DNA?
Is the other the father because he signed the birth certificate? 
Does it make her his child since she has his last name?

Any advice is appreciated! 

Location: Illinois ","I'm sorry to hear about the complicated family situation you're dealing with. It's important to clarify a few things before making any decisions. Have there been any legal documents signed regarding paternity or child support for this second daughter? If not, it might be worth considering consulting with a lawyer to understand the legal implications and potential next steps. It's also essential to remember that DNA evidence is the most definitive way to establish paternity, and it's important for all parties involved to ensure the best interests of the child are prioritized. Additionally, it might be beneficial to gather more information about the circumstances surrounding the birth certificate signing and the reason for the recent messages from the other woman.",neutral

"Hello. I am a machine learning student, I have been doing this for a while, and I found a concept called ""transfer learning"" and topics like ""fine tuning"". In short, my dream is to be an ML or AI engineer. Lately I hear that all the models that are arriving, such as Sam Anything (Meta), Whisper (Open AI), etc., are zero-shot models that do not require tuning no matter how specific the problem is. The truth is, I ask this because right now at university we are studying PyTorch and transfer learning. and If in reality it is no longer necessary to tune models because they are zero-shot, then it does not make sense to learn architectures and know which optimizer or activation function to choose to find an accurate model. Could you please advise me and tell me what companies are actually doing? To be honest, I feel bad. I put a lot of effort into learning optimization techniques, evaluation, and model training with PyTorch.","I understand that you're feeling uncertain about the role of transfer learning and fine-tuning in the context of recent advancements in machine learning models, such as zero-shot models. It's important to note that while some models may not require extensive fine-tuning, they often still benefit from it to achieve better performance. Additionally, different use cases and datasets may necessitate the application of specific optimization techniques or architectures.

As for companies, they often employ a combination of both zero-shot models and models that have been fine-tuned or trained from scratch, depending on the problem at hand. For instance, zero-shot models might be suitable for certain tasks, while fine-tuned models may be",neutral
"So there is a lot here for context, I'll my best to run through most of it. A year ago, my dad, who is around 50, ran off with a 26 year old. For context, I am 29. His stated reason for doing so was my stepmother's abuse. She could at times be horribly emotionally abusive and bordered on physically abusing us at times. However, this doesn't really mean anything because Dad could and should have separated from her, and then ran off with someone else, not the other way around. 

All of this put me in a sticky situation, where I tackled mixed feelings over it all. However, I tried to choose peace. I told her that she was still my second mom and that anything between them wouldn't change that. I showed up for birthdays and holidays and NEVER one-time commented on a single aspect of what was happening between them. I just keep reinforcing she and my younger siblings (15-16) would always be my family. During this time, I only ever got calls or texts from my stepmom that were meant to hurt my father. Her and the kids stopped buying me gifts. 

Mother's day arrived this year, and I tried to call her to see if I could visit. She didn't answer. I texted a nice message, she read it and did not respond. I called her mom and asked her to have my stepmom call me, and she never did. Fast forward to yesterday, and my Dad asked to go see the new fantastic 4 with him. I said yes, and he asked her if my little brother wanted to come with. She asked him who he was going with, and he said to me, and she said no. He's never allowed to see them again.

Idk what happened. I go to college 30 hours a week and work another 30. There have been no misunderstandings, no cold words, and no issues of any sort that she discussed with me or others around me. The best guess I have is I've gone to my Dad's new place a couple of times where he is living with his new woman, and she feels betrayed. 

Bless anyone who actually read this. I'm hurt that someone I thought was a mother figure to me was so quick to cast me to the side and block me off from seeing my siblings. No phone calls to discuss issues we, I guess, have. And to go the extra mile and keep me from maintaining relationships with my siblings is cruel and makes me wonder why she'd go so far to hurt me. Makes me wonder what's she's telling them is the reason I can't come out. She tells them horrible things about my father. To further complicate it, she called my dad's job and tried to get him fired, so I'm afraid to even reach out to figure out what happened. It's all so sad.

"Last night I posted about how to go about if (and how) I should explain to my father's wife (who is my age) that I need to be paid to care for him while she's at work all day. It would be 5 days a week for 7 hours per day (plus a 2 hour drive).  
  
In my post I explained past boundary issues (me struggling to draw them and them taking advantage of that) and how I wanted to try to be helpful but fair. You all were so kind, helpful and encouraging. 

The nurse came today to fill us in on the plan for in-home OT, PT, Nurse, etc -  and it will all be covered by Medicare - except of course a daily home aid (what I'm doing). I asked the nurse what that would cost and he said it's $45 per hour.

His wife had previously offered to pay me $100 per week for two days, so that's essentially $50 per day. But then it turned out they'll need me 5 days a week. Some of you suggested no less than $50/day. Many of you suggested much more for the entire week. I was actually considering staying at $100, maybe $150 per week. But today I decided if she was okay with $50 per day for two days, she should be okay with $50 per day in general, right?

So that's what I asked for, $50 per day which would be $250 per week. I had previously told her I cannot do weekends, as I'll need to rest and recover, and also because she runs around shopping for clothes and does lunch with friends all weekend, so it's hardly a necessity. 

I DO realize the amount is very low, but it even asking for that much was incredibly difficult for me and that amount will help me make ends meet and will be beneficial.

She looked like she was going to pass out, and then said ""That's $250 a week"". I said ""Yes, but here's the brochure for the home-aid place, they would charge you $1,575.00 per week. You would pay them for one hour what you'd pay me for the whole day.

So her next two comments are still puzzling me, but I'm overtired so maybe I'm missing something. First she said ""But I would be paying you myself, not from your father's account"". They keep separate bank accounts but she is listed on his accounts as a joint holder, so I really don't know what the issue is or what she was implying. She has access to both their accounts but he doesn't have access to hers, by their own weird mutual agreement. I honestly still don't know what her point was or what that has to do with me but she seemed to be implying something.  
  
I just said ""I guess you'll have to work that out with him, I'm not sure how you guys want to handle it"". She seemed to be saying she should pay less because SHE is paying me as opposed to HIM? But he's her husband, not mine, so the comment was confusing. Thoughts?

The second thing she said confused me even more, which was ""But can you work Saturdays?"" I said ""No, remember, I can't work the weekends, I will need to rest"". And she said ""But who will watch your father? I want to work overtime so I can pay you."" I said ""But you'd have to pay me for coming on a Saturday, so what would be the point?"" and she was quiet. I think she wanted me to work Saturdays for free so she could do overtime??? I'm honestly not sure. Like I said in my post last night, she will absolutely push me and take what she can. I sensed some sort of manipulation attempt but just shut down any idea of weekends.

I drove home thinking about how little $50 per day is for what the time investment and the level of care I'd be giving and felt less and less guilty. That works out to $7.14/hr which is less than minimum wage in my state and that's before the gas I'd have to use for the 2 hour drive each day. She's getting a bargain for bleep's sake.

She has a huge family who all help each other out and I am my father's only family. I guess if she doesn't like it, she can get one of her many family members to come do it for cheaper - but I highly doubt anyone would.

I would not have asked for even that small amount if it weren't for the supportive and encouraging comments last night in this sub. I have no family or support so it meant the world to me. Thank you.","I'm sorry to hear about the complexity of the situation you're in. It seems like there are a few financial and logistical issues at play here.

Firstly, it's unclear if your father's wife has the financial means to pay for your services beyond the initial offer of $100 per week for two days. It would be helpful to have a clear understanding of both parties' financial situations to determine a fair compensation.

"Hello!

My family moved into a new rental at the beginning of July. Less than a week after moving in, a police officer knocked on our door to inform us that our neighbor called the police because she believed we were “cooking drugs” in our unit. The officer stated that he had dealt with this neighbor several times in the past and he knew we were not engaged in any drug use.

Things calmed down for a little, but the other day, my wife said simple “hello” to the neighbor, who was staring at us as we walked by. The neighbor scoffed and was immediately hostile. This morning, I spotted the neighbor taking photos of our cars. I asked her why she was taking pictures, and she said “you know why, you’re druggies.” I mentioned that we are not drug users, and that we have a young daughter and my wife is expecting, to which she responded “yes, and I’m going to call Child Protective Services because of that.”

To be clear, the hardest drugs we have in the house are my wife’s antacids for pregnancy-related heartburn or my half-caf coffee. We do not even drink, let alone do any drugs. My job requires a drug test and background checks, including one from child protective services. 

I called the non-emergency line for our local PD and an officer responded. He told me they’ve interacted with this neighbor “dozens of times” and that she has some obvious mental health problems. He went to speak with her, but she somewhat quickly left her place out the back door, which I reported to the officer.

The officer advised us that, if this continues, to file harassment charges at the local magistrate. 

I also reached out to our new landlord to ask if there were any incidents with this neighbor in the past. He said no, but that this was a new property they were managing. I provided him with the incident number and the responding officer’s email.  He advised us to speak with a lawyer about this matter and would support us with the advice of counsel.

I am curious what we should do to prepare in this situation. We have never had issues with a neighbor before, especially for something that is completely unfounded. It feels like the local PD understands our situation, but I am still deeply uncertain living next to this person. I also do not want our new landlord to be suspicious of us because of what our mentally ill neighbor suspects. 

What are recommend next steps from a legal perspective on this matter?

TLDR Likely mentally ill neighbor called the cops on us for unfounded drug use. Police have dealt with her multiple times and even suggested harassment charges. Landlord advised speaking with counsel.

"So I have been in an online relationship for… going on 3 years now with my partner who has diagnosed autism. We’ve met up in person twice now and each time we have good chemistry.

I’m 24 female diagnosed with stage three uterine cancer. My first doctor told me I could save me eggs but I needed a full hysterectomy. I had an mri and he wouldn’t share my mri results until I had a second opinion. I went to Moffit for a second opinion and decided to stick with that doctor. The very first appointment I told her how important having children was to me and asked for recommendations to a fertility clinic. She said there was no need because she wasn’t going to remove my ovaries. She reiterated this at 2 other appointments I had with her. After a second dnc and mri she informed me that everything needs to go and I will probably need chemo so there’s no use in leaving my ovaries there anyways. I’m so heartbroken.

"I've noticed a trend this year of women unmatching if I don't respond to an app message within 24 hours which to me seems pretty fast. I could understand if it was 48-72 hours, but 1 day at the age of 35+ is perplexing. Everyone I know at our age is busy AF so I would expect some grace. Personally I work a highly demanding job that involves a lot of work travel and problem solving plus I have an active social life and do a fair amount of personal travel too. Sometimes I'm so busy that I don't even think to look at the apps for a day or if I do see the message I am just to mentally exhausted to formulate a response. However, I always attempt to respond within 24-48 hours whenever I feel like I can. I have no problem talking to people in real life, but I get really bad writer's block when texting strangers I've never met. This is often compounded by the fact that a lot of women have next to nothing to go off of other than pictures on their app profiles and will give short responses to messages that don't keep a flow to the conversation. I only bring this up because when I do respond to a message I put a lot of time and effort into thinking of a response that will hopefully keep the conversation flowing. While I used to think I was dodging bullets with quick unmatchers this is becoming more and more common which is frustrating because I am interested, but I feel like I am not being given a shot.

I don't expect other people to be accessible all of the time especially in the beginning of a new convo so I just can't wrap my head around this idea. Also, I almost never unmatch people, but to each their own. Burn out is real these days and as someone who went through it really bad more than once in the last 5 years I totally understand if folks need some time to collect their thoughts or need a grace period because they got caught up in life. 

Can anyone give me some insight here?

Edit: 

1) ""However, I always attempt to respond within 24-48 hours whenever I feel like I can."" I suppose this line is unclear. It's better to say that I usually respond within 24 hours, but it may take up to 48 hours to respond. I send a response when I feel like I can provide a decent response and not something low effort for the sake of responding. I tend to respond 32-48 hours at max. 

A. Clearly, I need to clarify further. I typically look at the apps once in the morning and once in the evening. If I'm busy, it may only be once in the morning. Occasionally, life happens, and I can't get to it for a couple of days. This is the exception to the norm. Most people I chat with take 14-24 hours to respond anyways so this has not been a real issue. I've just noted that people are quicker to unmatch these days and was looking for some insight.

2) I love the suggestion of sending a quick ""Hey, I'm busy today, but I'll shoot you a message later"" rather than leaving someone hanging. 
","Have you considered that different people have different communication styles and preferences when it comes to dating apps? Some might prioritize quick responses, while others might take more time to craft their messages. It might be helpful to try and gauge the other person's communication style before making assumptions about their reasons for unmatching. Additionally, it could be worth exploring alternative ways to keep the conversation going, such as asking open-ended questions or sharing interesting articles or experiences. Ultimately, everyone has unique circumstances and priorities, so it's important to approach each interaction with an open mind and a willingness to adapt.",neutral

"Long story short I gave my first bj a couple weeks ago and I can’t get it out of my mind. Not only was it nice just cause it was sexual, but it made me realize a lot of things about myself simple bc it was so intimate and it was impossible to not be affected by the nearness. This wasn’t even with someone I really know, just some cute guy for a hookup (with just my mouth).

During it, he put his hand on my back and it was the NICEST feeling.

I’ve gotten hugs from family, had acquaintances rub my back before but none of that has ever felt that good. I can still feel it, and that and the genuinely amazing feeling of intimacy makes me want to cry.

What makes me want to cry isn’t just that it felt so good and I realized what I’ve been missing out on, but the fact that letting someone that close makes them see the worst of me and it’s just not lovable and makes people not feel good so they associate me with bad feelings that they don’t want to be around.

I was so awkward, and the moment made me realize how much I dissociate around others, minimize myself, make myself say stupid things, accidentally say them too. It’s just a mess; a social freak at 28.

* **Left testis, radical orchiectomy:**
* **Organ-confined post-pubertal type teratoma:** The tumor is a teratoma (a type of germ cell tumor) that is confined within the testis and has not spread beyond it. ""Post-pubertal type"" refers to a form of teratoma that occurs after puberty, which behaves differently from pre-pubertal teratomas.
* **Spermatic cord margin negative for tumor:**
* **Pathologic stage pT1b pNX (AJCC 8th edition):**
   * **pT1b:** The tumor is limited to the testis but has certain features such as size or involvement that place it in this specific category.
   * **pNX:** Lymph nodes were not assessed or cannot be assessed (meaning they don't have conclusive data on lymph node involvement from this specimen).
* **No yolk sac tumor identified despite elevated AFP:** Although your blood tests showed elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker often elevated in yolk sac tumors, none was found in the tissue examined. They checked carefully using special stains (immunohistochemistry) and didn't find clear evidence of yolk sac tumor cells.
* **Small focus of germ cell neoplasia in situ:** This means there are some abnormal germ cells present in the testis that could be the source of elevated beta-hCG levels (another tumor marker).
* **Overall: Post-pubertal type teratoma with no clear evidence of other germ cell tumor components.**

It was removed with no evidence of more aggressive tumors, with clear margins and no invasive spread detected.   CT Scan with contrast only detected the 3cm teratoma, everything else looked clear.  X-Ray of the same area revealed bone structure also clear,   CT Scan without contrast of chest also showed clear results.

Pure mature teratoma (no yolk sac, no embryonal carcinoma, no choriocarcinoma).

* Confined to testis with clear margins.
* No lymphovascular invasion reported.

Blood Test Results - Surgery to remove the tumor occurred on June 16th

Estrogen, Blood, Serum  
June 5th 390  
July 8th 340

LD  
June 5th 1087  
July 8th 1300

This is a concern, but I had surgery and a hematoma formed, which could be a reason for this?

Beta-HCG, Quantitative  
June 5th 2050  
July 8th  1750

AFP

June 5th 321.4  
July 8th 560

This is the concerning part, also the surgery was on June 16th which could further increased the AFP in the time frame,  this is likely the cause of the concern and subsequent Chemo request?

No actual checks of the lymph nodes were done because the tumor was supposedly removed with clear margins,  The surgeon also detected a hematoma in the removed testis part which could also raise certain levels.

**Bottom line, here - is there a benign reasoning for this, should I request another blood marker panel first before just jumping straight into 3 months of destructive chemo,   I can still feel firmness on the surgery site given its still healing, and can feel the small lump of the hemotoma where the surgeon located it on my two-week post op appointment.**

**I know, microscopic spread was not confirmed, the surgeon started that tumor burn-out was his professional opinion,   I have an appointment with the oncologist on Wednesday and I feel like I should directly request a retest of the Beta HCG, LD and AFP at least,  if the AFP and LD are continuing to rise, that could mean - either microscopic spread or possible hidden tumor somewhere outside of the area's that were tested?**

Reasonable assumptions, could it also mean something sneaked by and infected some lymph nodes that are swollen,   that swelling also does not automatically mean cancer, they could be reactive to the pain, surgery too.

**On top of all this, my house is problematic for chemo therapy in general, we have cats, a dog and a cockatiel,  plus we have limited space, mildew issues and other potential issues.** ","I'm sorry to hear about your recent health concerns following your surgery. I can understand why you're feeling anxious about the unexpected increase in your blood test results, particularly the AFP and beta-hCG levels. Before jumping into aggressive chemo, have you considered discussing these concerns with your oncologist and requesting a more detailed explanation? It's important to remember that various factors can influence blood test results, such as recovery from surgery or the presence of a hematoma. Your oncologist may be able to provide additional insight into these possibilities. It might also be helpful to request further tests, such as additional blood panels or imaging, to rule out other potential causes. Ultimately, the best course of action would",neutral
"I’m gonna say it off the bat i know i am not a good person or justifying my actions. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months now. He is a very sweet guy and I was happy until about 7 months ago (i’ve been away for summer for 3 months) so i haven’t been around him much. Most of our time hanging out is with his roommates which i am also close with, but i’ll come back to that later. 

This summer, i have been snapping one of his roommates that i’ve had because we are all chill and he lives in the same home town city sometimes bc of his mom. we instantly connected and i realized how infatuated i was with him. which i always wanted to get to know him and was drawn to him just not to the level or type of interest i am now.

 we talk every day, call every day. while on the other hand my boyfriend is horrible as communicating with me which ive talked to him about and he fails make an effort to change. he only asks me abt my day and we’re long distance which is already hard enough. 

i also noticed how majority of the time him and i are alone he doesn’t say much, which i missed bc we are hanging out in the group setting 80% of the time. 

the roommate and i have a perfect connection and even finish each others thoughts or sentences/seem to have a weird empathic connection. 

he came back to his hometown to see his mom so i saw him and we may have cuddled and kissed and everything felt so right. 

i feel bad for my bf but at the same time o know he’s not the one for me.

"Lately I’ve been noticing how easy it is to lose time, hours of scrolling, endless notifications, always looking outward instead of inward. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve come to deeply value what truly brings me peace. 

This summer I started doing things I never made time for before. Walking barefoot in the grass. Making watercolour art outside. Dancing with my little cousins under summer sky. If you’re feeling burnt out, overstimulated or just numb, I highly recommend this. Step outside. Let summer remind you what it means to live in your body. Not everything worthy of your attention is behind a screen. 

Choose presence over passive consumption. Replace dopamine hits with real joy. Experience what it feels like to be curious, creative, connected without a screen.

This is what I did this summer. I visited new parks. Had a phone free picnic in our own yard with homemade food. My brother and I went to the splash pad like kids again and laughed until we couldn’t breathe. I floated on my back in a pool and let the sun touch my skin. Painted with ice chalk in the morning before my brain filled with notifications. Walked to get ice cream without headphones, just soft conversation. Helped my little cousins wash their play dishes with grass, water and giggles. We ran through sprinklers barefoot. Washed the car with Papa after a thunderstorm. We planted corn and measured how it grew.

We built a fort with leftover cloth and sticks. I tried geocaching (yes it still exists) and felt the thrill of hidden treasures. We jumped in puddles after rain. Built a backyard obstacle course with ropes, chairs and chalk. Created sidewalk masterpieces. Played follow the leader until we were dizzy. Watched a baseball game, no phones. Did scavenger hunts for feathers, odd rocks, yellow things. Identified trees. Picked sun warm peaches at an orchard. Built a drive in movie setup with bedsheets. Drew chalk roads and sent toy cars on adventures.

I danced in the rain. Bird watched early in the morning with binoculars. Went to a fair. Made water silhouettes on hot pavement. Caught fireflies in jars with holes punched in the lid. Flew a kite in the golden hour. Played tag with neighbourhood kids. Roasted s’mores. Ate dinner outside by candlelight. Made collages with flowers and leaves. Rode bikes slowly through quiet streets. Found feathers, smooth stones, heart shaped clouds.

I read outside. Watched clouds move. Painted on the porch. Invited friends for a no hands ice cream sundae party. Rolled down grassy hills. Camped in the backyard. Went on a boat ride at dusk. Built and painted a bird feeder. Had a wild outdoor dance party. Built a sandcastle with my neighbour’s daughter. Tie dyed old t-shirts. Made a time capsule. Did leaf rubbings. Went on an ABC scavenger hunt (A for ant, B for bark, C for cloud). Hula hooped like fools. Made pinecone bird feeders. Went camping. Played barefoot soccer. Jumped rope. Jumped again because it made me feel like me.

Went fishing with my uncle. Planted a garden with Mama. Lit sparklers, it felt like Diwali. Let the kids run wild while we watched them. Washed bikes. Painted flowerpots. Took hammock naps. Played cornhole. Sold lemonade. Did yoga on bare earth, no mat.

We turned delivery boxes into forts, cars, houses. Watched butterflies flit. Blew bubbles. Hosted a progressive brunch with neighbours, each house served a dish. Played bocce ball. Pretended to be pirates. Observed bugs with magnifying glasses. Played hide and seek. Had a 2000s music BBQ. Played ladder ball. Made garden markers with stones. Had a literal pie throwing contest. Watched another baseball game. Took a bird counting walk with my Aaju. Had a messy water balloon fight. Went horseback riding. Drew racetracks. Built DIY mini golf. Did a puppet show. Built a giant Jenga tower. Had a watermelon seed spitting contest. Watched the sunset in silence. Played tennis. Visited the farmer’s market. Weeded the garden I planted. Took care of it. Took care of me. Made a birdbath. Watched them come.

I did all of this instead of disappearing into a screen. Because I wanted my life back. This isn’t about being perfect. I still use tech. But now, it doesn’t use me.

And if you’re feeling wired, numb, lost I promise the cure isn’t online. It’s under the sky. Go outside. Do something real. Touch the grass. Feel the dirt. Hear yourself laugh again.

"My wife and I have been together for over seven years, and married for a while now. This has been the longest and happiest relationship I've ever had. But lately, I’m starting to feel like we’re moving in separate directions, and I don’t know what to do about it.

A little background. I’ve worked a few jobs over the years. None of them were careers I was passionate about, but they paid the bills, and that was enough for me. My wife, on the other hand, has been extremely dedicated to her job. She’s been working for the same retail bakery chain for the entire length of our relationship, and her hard work has paid off. She’s now the manager of her branch.

We recently moved in with her family here in California so we could save money. The plan was to eventually buy a house. We were thinking of moving to the Midwest since we both have family out there, and houses are more affordable. It felt like a step toward a better future, maybe even starting a family without financial stress.

But everything changed after she got back from a work convention. Now she says she doesn’t want to leave California. She doesn’t want to leave her job, and she’s okay with going back to renting instead of saving for a home. That hit me hard. Before we moved in with her family, we were barely getting by. The entire point of this sacrifice was to invest in our future.

I want to support her success, but I can’t help feeling like she’s prioritizing her career over the future we were building together. And to be honest, things have been rough in other areas too. Our sex life is almost non-existent unless I really push for it, and even then it sometimes feels like she’s just going through the motions.

I don’t know if we’re just going through a tough time or if this is the beginning of something more permanent. I love her, but I feel like I’m trying to hold on to a plan that she’s no longer committed to. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

"look i'm not a therapist or anything, just figured out something that helped my mental health and maybe it'll help someone else. If this sounds dumb, it probably is and sorry in advance.

I used to think being accountable to myself meant being harsh. like if i wasn't being ""productive"" or doing well mentally, i needed to track everything and push harder. but that just made me feel worse about myself most of the time.

the problem was tracking the wrong things. I was obsessing over streaks and consistency instead of paying attention to how things actually made me feel like for example i'd force myself to meditate for 20 minutes daily to keep my streak alive even when 5 minutes felt better. or i'd scroll social media then beat myself up about it instead of understanding why i was doing it.

So i switched it up to tracking three simple things for activities that are supposed to help my mental health: how calm i feel (1-10), how present I was (1-10), and how ready i feel to tackle things (1-10). that's it. no streaks, no guilt if i miss days.

what i love is it's not about being perfect instead it's about being curious. some days i take great breaks and feel amazing. other days i doom-scroll for 20 minutes and rate it a 2 for restoration. both are valuable because they build self-awareness about what actually helps my mental state versus what i think should help.

"Hello!

My husband and I have been living with my Grandfather for the past year. He's in a place with the disease where he really cannot live on his own, but he is adamantly resistant to moving from his home.

My husband and I are self employed, so it was easier for us then it would be for any other family members to care for him (admittedly it's been more of an undertaking than we thought it would be, but I was mentally prepared for that to be the case.)

What I need help with is this - although either myself or my husband can be home 99% of the time, there are occasions (even as simple as going for a long walk together outside) when we are not both there. He has gotten to a point where he will sometimes leave the stove/burner on, and I'm quite concerned about him starting a fire. We of course have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers in the kitchen, but I'm trying to figure out a system where I can get a push notification to my phone if an alarm is triggered in the home, but everything I'm finding is a much more complicated system then I want to set up.

I also don't want it to be some huge thing that is really noticeable to him, because any ""new"" item he's likely to throw away because he doesn't know what it is.

I know this may be more of a tech question then an Alzheimer's question, but I thought some folks here may have tried things that worked for them in similar situations! Any help/advice is much appreciated.","Have you considered installing smart plugs for the stove and setting up automation rules on a smart home system, such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, to turn off the stove after a certain period of inactivity? This way, you can receive a notification on your phone if the stove is left on for too long, even when you're not at home. Additionally, smart plugs are relatively unobtrusive and can be easily integrated into the existing electrical setup.",neutral

"Location: Florida

Yesterday, I met someone to give them a dog I've been trying to rehome. Things went well, and she seemed to like the dog and decided to move forward. She had a friend there that was a bit sketchy. All the info she had of me was an email, and my middle name. We emailed afterwards answering a couple questions: when's his birthday, how much to feed him, etc. Fast forward to today, I checked my email and there was nothing so I assumed she was doing good with the dog. I laid down to take a nap(we have a newborn), and was woken up by my wife saying two women were beating on our door. I was a bit disoriented(you know when you get woken up abruptly), and checked the nest. It was her. I was confused, we met at another location, and she had no info about me. I didn't answer, she told the nest camera she wanted to give the dog back. Then they left.

In the span of about 15 min, they leave messages on both mine and my wife's phones(numbers I didn't give them), and show up my work demanding I take the dog back(I'm on vacation). At this point I'm still confused and a little angry lol. I'm pretty non confrontational and at the same time my brother showed up. Half of me just wanted to call them back and just go get the dog, but the other half of me want nothing to do with people that show up to my job uninvited, much less my home. Before I could think through it, my brother texted and said it he was house sitting and that we were out of town lol, and that it was inappropriate that they showed up to my work. She texted back saying she doesn't want the dog because she's going to lose her apartment if she keeps it.

Is it kind of psycho that they tracked me down, found my job, and then showed up unannounced, or am I being paranoid? I gave them a bunch of dog stuff and dog food. I think one of the boxes had a address label on it and that's how they got it, but I'm not sure. Can I just ignore them, and possible file a incident report if they show up again?","I'm sorry to hear about the unexpected turn of events with the dog transfer.

"This is pretty fucked up, but my brother died two years ago. Shortly after his death, his dad (different dads) was able to sign into his iCloud account with the goal of finding pictures of him for his funeral and memorial posts. While I was in the depths of grief having just lost my older brother, his dad called me one afternoon pleading with me to go through his photo gallery so he and my brother’s grandmother could search his photo gallery for pictures/memories/etc.

Initially I refused (for obvious reasons). My brother’s dad told me he understood and that he would figure it out. Couple days later, I got a call from my brother’s grandmother who was crying because she couldn’t go through his pictures (mind you, all of this happened within a week of his death so emotions everywhere were through the roof).

I felt bad for her, and I felt bad for his dad and everyone else that wanted these pictures off his phone but didn’t want to potentially see any inappropriate pictures of him. I finally gave in and logged into his iCloud account and scoured his 1000+ picture gallery for anything he wouldn’t want his family seeing.

It was a lot. Both in the number of pictures and the mental strain this whole experience had on me - but I did it and his family was able to get the pictures they wanted.

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for clarity, perspective, and hope from people who’ve been through this.

Someone I care about (not a partner, but an ex that I managed to stay friends with) is going through what feels like a collapse. He has borderline personality disorder and is struggling with addiction. He recently relapsed for the first time ever on ketamine and cocaine. Prior to this he was an alcoholic that went to rehab for that. After trying to support him through treatment over the past month only to have him want help but then leave treatment AMA, I put up some boundaries and stopped engaging. I also refused to give him back his dog that I told him I’d watch while he was in rehab. Today, he texted me sad hopeless things like: 
	
“The meds just mess me up. I’m in a unique situation where the best meds don’t work for me. There’s only one left and I cannot take it. 

“Maybe drinking instead of using drugs is a win. harm reduction is good enough.”

“I’m dying, slowly but surely.”

“I need you to hate me.”


At the same time, he’s been isolating, sending concerning messages, and pulling away from people who care. But he also arranged for his sober coach to call me recently, and that call was calm, even thoughtful. It felt like he wanted someone to understand. Like he still wants help, even if he doesn’t know how to ask for it anymore.

I’m not his partner or family, but I’ve been holding a lot: caring for his dog, fielding emotional crises, and now trying to protect myself from getting overwhelmed. I’ve also been in touch with his dad, who’s trying to support him from afar and engaging with a lawyer to discuss possible guardianship (he’s a trust fund kid with unlimited access to money which makes this addiction cycle worse).

I’m torn between:

- Not wanting to abandon him
- Not wanting to co-sign his decline
- Wondering if this spiral is actually part of the path to something better?

So I guess I’m asking:

- Is this kind of collapse common before recovery? Do people get worse before they finally say “enough”?
- What does the beginning of true recovery look like and how can you tell the difference from false starts?
- What’s the most helpful thing someone like me can do? I’m not his partner, not his therapist just someone who cares a lot.

This is painful, confusing, and exhausting. I want to do the right thing, not the codependent thing. I want to hold space without holding the burden. I want to believe that recovery is still possible but I don’t know what that hope should even look like right now. And I’m scared and sad for him :(

If you’ve supported someone through addiction or BPD or Bi-Polar Disorder and watched them find their way eventually… I would be so grateful to hear what that looked like.

Thanks for listening.

"Hi, I need to make a decision on whether to keep or remove my right kidney+ureter, and the data I have so far is confusing to me (technically every result I have could be explained by inflammatory atypia, but the doctor seems to lean towards it being low-grade cancer). The doctor has recommended I think through my options, so I'm reaching out to this community to get your help (any similar examples, relevant info/research/guidance that could help me decide)

For context, I am a 60year old man who is otherwise healthy and has never had surgery or other major issues in my life. Nobody in my family history has had cancer. I do know many relatives who died after painful periods of dialysis though, hence my sensitivity in deciding whether to remove my kidney or not.

Below is the detailed chronological order of events:

1) My 2025 annual regular check-up identified the following in the ultrasound of my abdomen and chest: ""right gross hydronephrosis with hydroureter (upper) ? right PUJ obstruction"" 
It was recommended I contact a urologist about a kidney stone. I had been told about a small kidney stone in my 2024 annual check-up too but I ignored it and didn't make any lifestyle changes either (I used to not drink much water...)

2) I consulted Urologist #1, who recommended getting DTPA and CT scans. He was quite curt and didn't explain anything, and I got scared about doing a radioactive test so I decided to find another urologist to consult.

3) Meanwhile, I got a CT scan done: ""Gross right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to an enhancing lesion in the proximal ureter - HPE evaluation is suggested. A ureteric calculus at L5-S1 level is also noted. Right renal parenchymal thinning with mild reduced enhancement and delayed excretion - suggesting impaired renal function"". The kidney stone was noted as 1.3 x 0.9cm in size.

4) I also got a Creatinine test done: 1.18mg/dL

5) I consulted Urologist #2 in a separate hospital. He was more junior than the first one though so he seemed to overenthusiastically corroborate Urologist #1's findings and advocated for full right kidney+ureter removal ""just in case"".

6) At this point, I still hadn't found a urologist I felt comfortable with, so I identified Urologist #3 who is both senior and well respected. He was both better at explaining what is going on, and more conservative in approaching the problem, so I started following his advice. We scheduled Surgery #1 to remove the kidney stone, and take a biopsy. He managed to fragment the kidney stone but not entirely, and my ureter is super narrow by birth, so he wasn't able to get his telescoppe instruments up to the affected area to visualize and to biopsy. So we scheduled Surgery #2.

7) Meanwhile, I got a PET-CT scan done: ""Small area of focal high grade FDG uptake seen in circumferential mild enhancing soft tissue lesion in the proximal right ureter (at approx L3-L4 intervertebral level) over a length of 1.8cm and maximum thickness of 0.4cm, SUVmax 11.99. Perilesional prominent stranding in seen having indistinct fat planes with underlying psoas major muscle. Proximal hydroureteronephrosis noted with pelvic APD measuring - 4cm.""

8) We also got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #1: 
For sample 1: ""Smears and cell block show clusters of scattered benign urothelial cells and abundant crystalline material against a clear background. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""
For sample 2: ""Smears and cell block are predominantly hemorrhagic. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""

9) In Surgery #2, Urologist #3 managed to completely powder the kidney stone, and get a visual on the lesion and do the biopsy on the thickened right ureter. He ran an intraoperative biopsy test (Frozen section: cryostat sectioning, staining and microscopy): 
""FSA: focal urothelial hyperplasia with inflammation and atypia (? inflammatory). Final diagnosis on paraffin section.""

10) After the surgery, a second sample was submitted for more detailed biopsy. In this one, the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) done says ""The urothelial cells express CK7, while these are negative for CK20. p53 shows wild type expression."". The findings say ""Tiny tissue fragments are lined by hyperplastic urothelium. Focally the lining epithelium is polypoid and shows increased thickness of more than ten layers. The lining epithelial cells are fairly monotonous with mild nuclear enlargement. No mitotic activity is seen. The underlying edematous lamina propria contains lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The inflammatory cells extend into the overlying urothelium at places. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""
The final pathological diagnosis is listed as:
""A. Biopsy from thickened right ureter, intraoperative consultation: low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive.
B. Upper/mid right ureteric lesion: histomorphology favors a papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""

10) We got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #2: ""Hemorrhagic smears and cell block reveal few coherent and papillaroid clusters of urothelial cells showing mildly pleomorphic hyperchromatic oval to round nuclei with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The background shows few inflammatory cells comprising predominantly of neutrophils along with lymphocytes.
Final pathological diagnosis: cytological features are suggestive of low grade urothelial neoplasm, TPS Category V. A biopsy confirmation is essential.""

10) Urologist #3 interpreted these as being stage 1 transitional cell carcinoma, with the good news being the cancer cells have not penetrated any layers yet. He did recommend doing a DTPA test, and getting a second opinion on the biopsy from one of the best histopathologists around who has 40+ years experience with challenging cases.

11) DTPA result (remember that this was done only 11 days post-operation, so actual numbers may be higher post-recovery): 
""Left kidney: 86.5%, 44.2ml/min. 
Right kidney: 13.5%, 6.9ml/min. 
Total GFR: 51.1ml/min""

12) Second opinion on the biopsy samples:
""Microscopic appearance: The biopsy from the upper right ureter and mid ureter reveals benign polypoidal urothelial mucosa with an edematous stroma. On evaluation with IHC, p53 is not overexpressed and Mib-1 is extremely low & CK20 is negative.
Impression: Biopsy of a thickened right ureter and upper/mid right ureteric lesion: benign polypoidal inflamed urothelial mucosa with inflammatory atypia in the nuclei.""

13) Urologist #3 was completely dismissive of the second opinion for the biopsy. He stated that based on the first biopsy report, urine cytology results from Surgery #2, the visual he had when performing surgery, and the PET-CT report, he is convicted it is cancer and not atypia, and he recommends removing the kidney+ureter entirely. It is ultimately my choice though.","I'm a medical researcher and I'd be interested in understanding more about the pathology report findings, specifically the discrepancy between the two biopsy interpretations.

"Here are the top ten most important things to learn if you think you may have symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (or early cognitive decline):

🧠 1. Know the Early Symptoms
Recognize warning signs beyond typical aging:

Memory loss affecting daily life

Trouble with planning, problem-solving, or managing finances

Difficulty with familiar tasks

Word-finding problems

Disorientation (time or place)

Mood, personality, or behavior changes

🧪 2. Understand the Diagnostic Process
Diagnosis often involves:

Cognitive testing (e.g., MoCA, MMSE)

Blood tests (to rule out B12 deficiency, thyroid problems, etc.)

Brain imaging (MRI or PET scan)

Newer tools like the PrecivityAD blood test or CSF biomarkers

Genetic testing (like APOE4) may be considered but isn’t definitive on its own

🧬 3. Learn About Risk Factors
Risk increases with:

Age (especially after 65)

APOE4 gene status

Family history

Head injuries, poor sleep, smoking, sedentary lifestyle

Cardiovascular issues (high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol)

💊 4. Know the Available Treatments
Currently approved medications:

Donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine, galantamine – help with symptoms

Memantine (Namenda) – for moderate to severe stages

Lecanemab (Leqembi) – a newer drug targeting amyloid plaques, slows progression in early stages

🧩 5. Explore Lifestyle Interventions That May Help
There’s strong evidence for:

Exercise (especially aerobic and strength training)

Mediterranean or MIND diet

Sleep hygiene

Social engagement

Cognitive stimulation

Blood sugar and blood pressure control

🧠 6. Know That Some Memory Loss Is Reversible
Check for and treat:

B12 deficiency

Thyroid disease

Depression (can mimic dementia)

Medication side effects

Sleep apnea

Alcohol overuse

Hearing loss

🧭 7. Plan Ahead: Legal, Financial, and Medical
Start early with:

Advance directives and living wills

Power of attorney (medical and financial)

Long-term care planning

Discussing care preferences with family

🗂 8. Track Symptoms and Stay Organized
Keep a daily log of symptoms (memory lapses, confusion, mood)

Bring a trusted person to doctor appointments

Use medication organizers, reminders, and calendars

Ask for a written summary after each medical visit

🧑‍⚕️ 9. Find Support and Educate Loved Ones
Local Alzheimer’s Association chapters offer education and support groups

Family members benefit from learning communication techniques (e.g., validation, not correcting)

Online communities can help ease isolation and fear

🧭 10. There Is Life After Diagnosis
Alzheimer’s is progressive, but many people live with purpose, humor, and creativity for years after diagnosis. Planning, adapting, and getting support early can extend quality of life and autonomy.

"Not about OLD for once ;), but about flirting out there — in the wild. 

I read in Logan Ury's book, that you should try to get in the mindset of, ""Always be flirting,"" (obviously this is within reason and not being weird or creepy if someone is distant or uninterested). But I realize like most people who are mainly on OLD to date, that my flirting with strangers is rustyyy.

Thanks, fellow single friends! ","I've also struggled with flirting in person, despite being quite outgoing online. It can be a different ball game entirely. One tip I've heard is to focus on finding common ground or shared interests as a way to start a conversation. This can help create a connection and make the interaction feel more natural. For example, commenting on the music playing in the bar or the food you're both ordering can be a good starting point. Have you tried this approach, or do you have any other suggestions for starting a flirtatious conversation in the wild?",neutral

TLDR: I have a benign bronchial duplication cyst that makes me wonder if my LC is actually just symptoms of this chest mass and I’m being deceived into thinking I have long COVID be bad doctors. Also had my 16th er visit the other day. 


I’m sure that what everyone here is experiencing is happening, so I don’t mean “oh it’s all in our heads” or whatever. But for me personally I have another issue that makes me doubt if I’m suffering from LC or not. During my first ER appointment they found a noticeable mass in my chest which has been pretty well investigated. It’s a congenital bronchial duplication “cyst.”The thoracic surgeon told me they don’t usually cause the issues I am experiencing, like vision problems and cognitive issues- however they do causes swallowing problems and shortness of breath, chest pressure, that sort of thing. So half of my problems at least could be related to that, and in rare cases maybe even the neuro stuff!! But it’s also rare for these things to even cause noticeable symptoms at all, so I have no way of knowing. 

I would say 80% of doctors I see have never heard of long COVID so when I see someone new they bring up the chest mass and then I start wondering all over again if my problems really are all from this mass and I’m just deluding myself about the long COVID. The rest of the time if people do think it’s COVID I get nothing out of it.

I went to the ER for the sixteenth time in 2 years the other night… I’ve been 16 times for real. It was like 1am and I had been woken up with terrible left sided weird issues again and felt like maybe I was having some cardiac problem. Just awful. Numb, suffocating chest neck left arm, sob, the usual, but worse. The doctor who saw me was good, and she insisted I needed a primary to really be keeping up with me, and told me to be aggressive. She questioned me about the chest mass and refered my cardio thoracic surgery.

I’m just so tired of this. It took me 5 month to even get scheduled with cardiology and it will be another 2 months to get seen. I made 30 phone calls trying to get scheduled. I even sent them the damn ekg they “maybe” needed myself and they never could access it. I’m not sure how to be MORE aggressive, and at this point I hate myself for even being polite anymore. I was never a pushy or demanding person, but now it’s like the fact that I’m not a raging entitled asshole is working against me because the medical system is so bad. 

Having all this uncertainty for 2 years is so draining. Is it the chest cyst? Is it just LC because it has all those symptoms too but you’ll never know because you can’t test for it?? Is it BOTH? What if I end up getting surgery to have it removed and it solves NOTHING and then I have to heal from chest surgery and have long COVID. What if I never even had long COVID and they were wrong about this cyst and it’s pressing on my nerves and that’s why I can’t use my hands properly anymore when I’m upright. 

The cognitive haze is just horrible. The number one thing that makes me think I’m dealing with LC is the brain fog, because no one else is describing it like the people on here who have it. 

I don’t know why I’m even writing this. I know nobody here has an answer either, and everyone is suffering. I just really hope I get some sort of solid answers soon because life where every single one of your senses and activities is impacted is really the final test of endurance","I'm really sorry to hear about your health struggles and the uncertainty you're facing. It must be incredibly challenging to navigate the complexities of your condition, especially when dealing with conflicting diagnoses. 

Given your description of your symptoms and the findings from your medical exams, it seems that both the benign bronchial duplication cyst and long COVID are possibilities. It's important to remember that medical conditions can overlap, and it's not uncommon for individuals to experience multiple health issues at once. 

Have you considered discussing this with your healthcare providers? They might be able to provide more insight into how these conditions could be related, or if there's a way to differentiate between",neutral

"**Edit:** Putting this at the top. To explain my situation a bit better and maybe to put things another way, I think I'm having a hard time with dating again because currently I feel happy a lot of the time and am actually doing okay being single. But a big part of that is me putting a lot of energy into being intentional about how I take care of myself. I think dating other people will throw that energy off. I'm still navigating this and trying to find a healthier relationship with my approach to dating and being around other people.

\-

I've(40m) been trying to figure why I feel so blah about trying to date again. It's been a year since I was out there on the apps. I tried more speed-dating events recently and they've been okay, but even with getting matches I just felt kind of over it.

I'm sure part of this is feeling hurt or jaded from past dating. However, I've come to realize that these feelings of meh are because I've actually been afraid to lose my emotional freedom. Personally I've been in sort of a transition period over the last year. It's only been in this time-frame that I've found the well in the clearing where self-compassion, self-love and ability to self-sooth reside. Still working on that muscle. So when I say emotional freedom I mean the ability to pour into my cup and not others. My last big relationship and all the people I've dated since have been about me pouring too much energy into them, leading to co-dependency and losing myself in the process. Yes, dating is emotionally exhausting, but I see that that's partly of my own doing.

Something else that's new for me is a sense of self-agency. I'm still trying process that and a lot of other things, but these feelings of self-agency have felt absent for my entire life. Which explains not being able to drive where I'm investing my emotional energy.

So the question I have for others is how much self-agency do you feel you have in a relationship? How much is healthy? I have to be honest, it's still making me uncomfortable thinking about showing love and kindness to myself while in a relationship as I'm afraid it will take away from a need I have to invest in the other person. I guess I'm partly looking for re-assurance that one should maintain some autonomy in a relationship and that it's okay to pour into your own cup. Yes, it sounds crazy to me to be writing that too. But I am still coming to terms with it and trying to see what it looks like in a relationship.

This post might also help others. Definitely encourage you to think about where you actually are with these things personally.

Also, I really appreciate everyones in-depth response to my last post.","I can understand where you're coming from, and it's interesting to see how your personal growth has impacted your perspective on dating. One question that comes to mind is, have you considered seeking out relationships where both parties prioritize self-care and personal growth? This could potentially allow for a healthier balance of giving and receiving emotional energy. Additionally, have you looked into the concept of ""attached"" versus ""anxious"" or ""avoidant"" attachment styles in relationships? Understanding these dynamics might help you navigate your feelings of self-agency and emotional freedom in a more informed way. Best of luck in your journey!",neutral
"Location: I'm in California, my mom died in Mexico and my Grandma died in Maryland. This is being managed in Maryland for reference. 

Basically my mom died when i was 16, I lived with my adoptive father (her husband) and my grandma died a month afterward. My mom only has 2 other siblings, her brother and sister, and they were my grandmas only family. Well my adoptive father sucked, he stole all my survivor benefits from me and kicked me to the streets. So from ages 16-21 I have been living paycheck to paycheck, didn't ever see university as a possibility, and had all but given up. 

Just yesterday, my uncle contacted me for the first time since I was 16 to tell me I've inherited everything my grandma was going to give to my mother... a little over 200k. This is an amazing thing and I'm shocked. I can have small portions of it monthly, but will get it all at age 22. (allegedly this is what they've told me)

But why wait so long...? The only other time he's contacted me was to text me when my mom and grandma died. Not even a phone call. This was the first time I've ever spoken to him over the phone. They've been letting me struggle this entire time. I have this feeling like they were waiting for me to off myself or something so they could keep the money. It's weird right?!

"I’m not sure how it came about, but I was with him on the phone and we were joking around. I just started a work situation which will remove me from my home country to another for two months at a time, every couple months. This was the first two months, and I was a bit worried about our relationship. However, it all went perfectly. I was not worried at all, even though I struggle with intense anxiety. We didn’t text much or feel the need to constantly talk, but sometimes when I grabbed my phone to text him that I missed him, I would see he had texted me the same just minutes before. I’m happy to have time to focus on myself, but also miss him dearly. 

Anyway, I was joking about this “timeline” I have for my life which would include getting engaged and/or married in my late twenties, and how I told my friend that “if he doesn’t change drastically, I wanna get engaged to him in 3 years” and he immediately went “oh, I told my friend more like in 2 years…” 

Our relationship is still quite fresh, so this engagement estimate might or might not happen; and in any case the wedding would not immediately follow. But, not so long ago, I was in a severely abusive relationship that I still fight the effects of. I thought my life was forever changed, and that it would take me ages to find happiness again, and that I’d never be ready to trust someone again. As I said it’s fresh, so the honeymoon feelings are still very real, but I’ve never felt so safe and cared for in any other relationship, at any time in it. He just doesn’t give me anything to stress or worry about. We resolve our conflicts very well, and he honestly inspires me to become a better person, which I’ve also never felt before. I’m making leaps and bounds in therapy and combatting the lasting effects of being in an abusive situation such as PTSD, anxiety, and anger. He’s just so nice to me that it makes me want to be nothing but nice and caring back! And I don’t have to be the bigger person at all, it’s simply what he deserves for how he treats me and everyone else in his life.

After being in an abusive situation; it feels impossible to trust again, but he proves to me time and time again that he appreciates me as I appreciate him, and that I am not being duped again, and that he does really care for me. I always like when he tells me he talks about me to his friends, but the fact that he’s talking about possibly proposing to me made me feel so unbelievably fuzzy. We’re both young, it might not happen that way, but the fact that he wants to right now and is voicing that makes me so happy. It’s also nice because I’ve known I wanted to get married eventually for a while, but could not imagine any of my exes at the end of the isle, for some reason? It just felt out of place, or unrealistic, or it just didn’t make sense as an image. 
I can imagine him clear as day though, and think about it sometimes.

"Location: Ontario

Background:
* My mom immigrated to Toronto over 30 years ago and started a successful business.
* My dad married her, they ran it together, and later he took over while she stayed home to raise us.
* In 2014, her father died, and she went back home to Africa for nearly a set year to settle affairs (she's the eldest of 20 siblings). My dad encouraged her to go and gave her his full support.
* While she was away, he sold their business for $1.4 million and their home for $660k. He told her he bought a house mortgage-free in a small town in Ontario so we could live interest-free (we’re Muslim).
* She returned to find the house was much smaller and in poor condition, but let it go.
What Went Wrong:
* In 2014, they ""bought"" a new house worth $255k. He claimed it was paid in cash and both their names were on it.
* In 2019, my dad secretly married another woman abroad and had kids with her. He left our home and doesn’t live with us anymore.
* In 2022, we found out that my mom's name was removed from the title of the house in January 2021, even though she was in Edmonton from Dec 2020 to March 2021 (we have proof of her travel).
* He used an imposter to pose as my mom and sign title transfer papers, removing her from ownership. The lawyer admitted (on recording) that they accepted the ID after the meeting via WhatsApp.
* He then took out a $260k mortgage on the house (original mortgage was $130k), paid that off, paid $18k of his own credit card debt (in my mom’s name), and sent me $20k randomly to invest in a business for my aunt.
* He kept about $90k and disappeared.

How We Got Stuck:
* We found out a year later, after he stopped paying the mortgage, and the lender said they'd foreclose unless we paid it all off.
* My mom had no income or credit. So in 2023, my sister and I (both working/students) were pressured to take out a $310k private loan with high interest just to save the house.
* At the last minute, my dad refused to transfer the house fully to us unless he got 50% ownership, even though he doesn’t live here and doesn’t pay anything.
* We’ve been paying $2800/month since, while juggling jobs, school, and financial strain.
* The house has mold, leaking, and broken doors/windows. At best, it might sell for $400k as-is.
Legal Situation:
* We went to the police in 2022. They told us it was a civil matter and we needed to get a lawyer. We filed a report but haven’t heard back.
* Our lawyer at the time said we should pursue this through family law, not civil fraud, since it was ""hard to prove fraud.""
* We have evidence:
    * Fake signature vs real one
    * Travel proof showing my mom wasn’t in the province when the title was signed
    * A recorded conversation with the lawyer admitting they didn’t verify ID properly

❓My Questions:
1. Can we still go to the police and push for criminal charges (fraud, impersonation, forgery)?
2. Can we sue my dad through family court and get my mom’s share of the house back?
3. If we sell the house now, will he get 50% even though we paid everything since 2023?
4. Would it help to report the lawyer to the Law Society of Ontario for negligence?
5. What are our best legal options right now to stop bleeding money into this mess?

Any help, advice, or direction would mean the world. We're just trying to protect our mom and not go under financially.

"For context, my father is Muslim and my mother is anti-religion. Don’t ask me how they came to marry. They’re long divorced and my father has now found his ideal Islamic family. From my stepmother I now have 7 step siblings, ranging from 14-32. 

Long story short he happened to meet them for the first time this week and I did tell him they’d be in traditional wear, that my father might even be wearing a “dress” (thawb) with the women wearing hijabs and abayas. On the way back to our town he mentioned wishing i could dress more modest like they do and asked if i could.

he didn’t like this answer. I don’t even dress immodestly like that, i was shamed for wearing skinny jeans as a kid. im very overly attentive to what i wear and how it makes me look.

"I’m 27, and I feel like my life has already ended. I’m just dragging out what’s left of it until I hit the deadline I gave myself which is age 30. If things don’t change by then, I’m done. I’ve made peace with that.

There was a time I actually lived. I had friends I loved, nights full of laughter, hours lost in games that made me feel connected, present, human. I used to have goals. I cared about things. I was excited to wake up. I was curious about the world and my place in it.

Now there’s nothing. I’ve lost everyone. The people I used to be close with have vanished. The things that brought me joy feel dead. I try to play games and I just sit there, empty. Music doesn’t move me. I barely eat. I barely sleep. I barely feel.

"Gf and I ain’t been dating long but she’s got this male friend who has confessed his love for her. 

At first, I had a conversation with her revolving around my boundaries with this and how it makes me uncomfortable that she’d entertain a relationship that is so obviously not platonic. 

They text every day all the time, he does everything she asks of him, and all around he’s just got puppy dog eyes for my girl. 

She’s even introduced me to him amongst a few other of her friends and we said no more than 5 words to one another throughout the entire night. It was obvious from the start he didn’t care for me so I saw no point in entertaining a conversation despite the entire reason I was there was to meet him. 

In an effort that I probably shouldn’t have made, because I know she sees him as her best friend, I told her I didn’t mind them working out together at the gym but I’m heavily against them hanging out one on one outside of there. In my eyes, I was/am making an effort for her to maintain her friendship with this man within boundaries that I find acceptable within myself. 

Issue is, through those boundaries, I have learned he talks shit about me behind my back despite not knowing me. This is what pisses me off. This plants seeds of doubt that she is either too naive to acknowledge or that she is brushing off. This is unacceptable to me at it is directly disrespectful to me and my relationship. 

Additionally, she confides our issues in this man which I am also heavily against. Since their relationship is not platonic, due to him being in love with her, he obviously will say things that can sway her mind away from me little by little at a time. 

Her justification for keeping him in her life is that he’s been there through “thick and thin” for the past 4 years. In my eyes he ruined that “thick and thin” the moment he told her he was in love with her because the motive is different. It’s not a friendship motive. It’s a love motive.

I was at a Nissan dealership. I was going to use my car as a trade in. No down payment but if I had one it would be $500 atm

Today my car will not crank... called off work for the rest of the week because unlike most people with parents and help from family I DO NOT HAVE THAT. Therefore, I am stuck in this situation and unsure of what to do. 

I DO NOT HAVE ANYONE to cosign for me. If I did that would have been an option from the start. I don't want my job to fire me because I'm missing so many days of work. What should I do?  ","I'm sorry to hear about your car troubles and the difficulty you're having getting approved for a loan. Have you considered reaching out to local credit unions or other lenders that may have more flexible credit score requirements than traditional dealerships? Additionally, have you looked into alternative transportation options such as public transportation or carpooling to work? It might be worth exploring these options in the meantime while you explore other financing options. Best of luck to you during this challenging time.",neutral
"I hate going to school with people who don't realize how easy they have it. I got into my dream school at a very young age, but ended up having to drop out because we could not afford it. My mom and I would not get approved for loans, and FASFA and Pell didn't help much either. 

Currently working 2 jobs. One of them was an unpaid internship, the other a minimum wage internship, but at a very reputable, well-known company. I don't have ""connections"" or the uncle who could make the phone call to get me into the door. I have to break my way in forcefully. Well, my rent just went up, I need to buy a car, and I still owe money. Thinking of getting another job and working night shifts since my paid job has very limited hours. 

I happen to work and go to school (not live in) a very wealthy suburban area where all the kids here are nepo babies who can go to Europe every month and have their rich parents pay for their driving lessons. I'm not even 20, and I have to worry about all this. Probably going to join the military to get some money lol.  Does anyone else relate to my struggles? It would be nice to hear some advice from people in similar situations. ","I'm really sorry to hear about the financial challenges you're facing. It's a tough situation to be in, especially when it comes to affording higher education and making ends meet. Have you considered exploring other financial assistance options or grant programs that might be able to help cover some of your expenses? I know it can be a daunting process, but it might be worth looking into. Additionally, have you thought about reaching out to organizations or charities that focus on helping individuals in your situation? They might be able to provide resources or advice that could be helpful. Good luck, and keep pushing forward. It's a difficult road, but you're not alone in this.",neutral
"I'm simply curious.  I've searched back about 4 years worth of posts, but didn't see anything this specific.  I'd also like to hear from anyone who may have taken a short course, preferably not super high dose.  I started getting neuropathy, worsened tinnitus, and worsened fatigue during this crash.  Mid day, I can barely keep my eyes open.","Have you considered consulting with a healthcare professional or a pharmacist to discuss the potential interactions between the immunosuppressive medication and your symptoms?

"Every time I tried to reset, restart, or refocus, I failed again. Not because I was weak or lazy but because I didn’t understand why it kept happening.

Today I realized something simple but deep.
The door that locks you in is already open. The person holding you back is just… you.



In my case, the last block between me and my raw potential was social anxiety. I kept thinking I needed another plan, another reset but what I really needed was to act like the version of me I daydream about. The one who is free, bold, and untouchable. I have also shared my lessons from trying on my sub red. 

And here’s the truth I now believe:
Most successful people don’t have their strength by default. They earned it by fighting its opposite.

Rich people often knew deep poverty.
Confident people lived in anxiety.
Kind people have seen cruelty.
Leaders have lived through helplessness.

I know its easy to say but very hard to do but thats what life is about,
You either fight through it and earn your gift…
Or you surrender and live behind the open door forever.","I'm glad to hear about your personal growth and the insights you've gained. It's interesting how often the biggest obstacles can be internal. Have you considered seeking the help of a therapist or coach to work through your social anxiety? There are also various techniques and resources available that may be beneficial. Additionally, have you tried practicing mindfulness or meditation to help manage your anxiety and improve your focus? These are just a few possibilities to consider, and I wish you the best of luck on your journey towards becoming the bold and untouchable version of yourself.",neutral
"I (26F) have been taking care of my little sister (8F) ever since our mom passed away three years ago. Our dad left long before that, and there’s no other family around. I went from being a wild 23-year-old figuring out her life, to full-time guardian overnight.

Some days I still don’t feel like an adult. I burn dinners, I cry in the shower, and I google “how to make a kid eat vegetables” like it’s a crisis. But I love her more than anything. I gave up a lot of my freedom, but never once regretted choosing her.

Last night, we were watching cartoons before bed and she curled into my side and asked softly, “Is it okay if I call you Mom sometimes?” I didn’t know what to say. I felt this weird ache in my chest. Like, I was honored... but also heartbroken that she even needs to ask that. That she’s missing that space in her heart.

I told her she could call me whatever makes her feel safe. She smiled and said, “Okay, Mom,” like it was the most normal thing in the world.

I didn’t cry in front of her. I waited until she fell asleep.

I just needed to put this out somewhere. I don’t think I’ll ever be ready for the weight of that word, but for her, I’ll carry it anyway.","""I can imagine how difficult and emotional that moment was for both of you. Have you considered talking to a counselor or support group to help navigate these feelings and the challenges of being a guardian at such a young age? It's important to take care of yourself as well as your sister. Also, have you tried involving her in meal planning and preparation to make vegetable consumption more fun and engaging for her? Sometimes a change in presentation or making it a game can make a big difference.""",neutral
"Location: Sangamon County, IL

Im disabled and new neighbors moved in next door. They dont work, from 6am to 11pm they sit on their porch yelling on their phone and smoke newports. For the last 2 weeks every other day or if i leave the house, they stop me, asking for money, soda or cigarettes, never food.

I've declined and explained my financial situation as im barely scraping by. After the 3rd time I asked them to stop asking... after that they waited until I left the house and went to ask my boyfriend for money (like we don't communicate....).


If i call the police it'll just cause more drama and won't stop it. I don't want to even check the mail now because I get anxiety as it is and am afraid of the confrontation. When I mentioned i was disabled they quickly asked when my deposit comes in and for detailed info which of course I said mind your own business.

Permanently disabled since 2019
2 back surgeries with titanium inserted
Cannot walk without a cane and medication 
I receive disability and food stamps which allows me to buy the minimum needed to survive.

Have you considered reaching out to local community resources or organizations that might be able to offer assistance or mediation in this situation?

"I'm an introvert.
Comfort zone is my favorite place. I don’t talk much, and I definitely don’t perform.

But during college, a friend of mine secretly told our professor that I sing and play the guitar.
Guess what happened next?

I got forced onto the stage.

There I was, standing in front of maybe a thousand people (or more, who knows, I couldn’t even raise my face). My heart was pounding. My palms were sweaty. I felt like I was going to throw up.

But then...
I took a deep breath.
Told myself, “Ignore everyone. Just play.”

I started with “Aaro Ekbar” by Rupam Islam.
And when that iconic drop came“eyyya yyeah”
The crowd went CRAZY.
People shouted.
They sang along.
They felt it.","That's an interesting experience you had. How did the professor react when you were suddenly put on stage? Did they give any reason for doing so, or was it a surprise to them as well?

"I'm scared.  I was able to deal with the tinnitus I got about 1.5 years ago which was roughly half a year into LC.  Now, I'm having a very bad crash where I am extremely tired, sleepy, getting some neuropathy issues, and on top of it it, worsened tinnitus in the form of increased volume in the existing ear and a higher tone in my other ear.  Oddly enough, this newer higher tone is the most disturbing during the day.



I'm hoping this goes away after the crash, but this crash doesn't seem to be budging anytime soon.  I'm eating better (Whole Foods).  I'm staying home as much as possible.

I'm staring at very low dose prednisone but very afraid to take it.  Any input or help would be greatly appreciated.","I'm sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time with your health. Tinnitus can be quite distressing, and it's understandable that the worsening of your symptoms, along with the new neuropathy issues, is causing you concern.

Have you consulted with your doctor about the possibility of taking prednisone? It might be helpful to discuss the potential benefits and risks with a medical professional before making a decision. Additionally, have you considered other options like relaxation techniques, white noise machines, or cognitive behavioral therapy for managing the tinnitus? These approaches may help improve your overall well-being and reduce the perceived impact of the tinnitus.

"On my day 4 of rebuilding myself 
i learnt...
We don't just fear failure, we fear visibility. The idea of people seeing us try, seeing us mess up, watching us stumble as we figure things out… it terrifies us.
So we stay silent. We ""prepare more."" We wait to be perfect before we show up.

But the truth is: if you want to grow, you have to be seen. Seen trying, seen failing, seen getting back up.
You can’t stay in the shadows and expect to make an impact. You don’t beat fear by waiting it shrinks only when you move through it.

If this hits even one person out there who’s been holding back, just know: you're not alone, but it’s on you to show up anyway.","I'm curious, have you come across any research or studies that specifically examine the relationship between visibility and fear of failure in the context of personal growth and development?

"Hi there, sorry in advance if I do it wrong, it's my first time posting but I need advice.

So basically what the title says, my dad is overall good father, well besides sometimes - recently more often than not being a complete dick to me. His teasing involves that thing when you lock in a person and with closed fist scratch the top of the head, blocks my way and when I try to get past he grabs my wrists - crushes them in one hand and tries to pull my nose with the other, shoves me into the wall.

Yesterday he shoved me into glass cabinet and when I tried to go pas him he blocked my way and pushed me back. I screamed for him to stop, but he just laughed. My mother stood by and just told him to stop. I swore at him to basically 'fuck off' when I couldn't take it any longer and both my dad and mother looked offended. I started crying from the stress and finally I could go away, but not before him mocking my sobbing. Later I heard his conversation with my mom where she asked him why won't he stop he basically said 'What, I'm just happy, am I to better hang myself?'

When I ask it doesn't work, when I swear I don't respect my parents, when I try to remove myself from the situation my attempts are blocked.

Is there a way for me to tell him otherwise to stop? It brings me a lot of distress and he doesn't do those things to my brothers, sometimes to my mom, but she has better authority when she tells him to stop. I can't ask anyone for help in my circle, for noone cares as everyone says it's just 'playfull teasing' or some holier than thou aunties bash it behind his back but laugh when he does thosw things to me.

"A week ago, my father died by suicide, and it's turned my world upside down. He was my rock and the person I loved most in the world.

For some back story, my parents had a toxic relationship my whole life, they were married for a few months and divorced a month before I was born, constantly in custody battles, and often used me to hurt each other. I was exposed to a lot of mental manipulation from both sides, but especially from my mom.

Since my dad’s passing, my mom says I can talk to her about how I'm feeling, but when I do, she reacts in really uncomfortable ways. She’ll say things like, ""You still have your mom,"" or ""I'm not dead yet,"" or she’ll roll her eyes and avoid sitting with me when I ask to talk. If I don’t talk, she gets upset. If I do talk, she gets offended. It's like I'm walking on eggshells no matter what.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

"I have to start by saying I 38F typically let my heart lead me, but this time I feel I need to follow my gut. I’ve been with the man I love 46M for over a year. We are both divorced and each have one child. They are the same age. We care deeply for one another, he treats me like a queen, he is so sweet, understanding and genuine with me. So far, it all sounds great, right? I’ve been considering moving to be with him but tonight I feel strongly like I should end things. The following issues feel insurmountable to me. 

1.	⁠I have worked very hard to be independent and care for my child alone. I just finished my master’s degree after 3 incredibly difficult years of single parenting, working, and attending school. I’m not sure I’m ready to give up that independence, even if it means continuing to go it alone (which is honestly exhausting, but so is this relationship).
2.	⁠He has a lot of health issues and I am beginning to think he needs a caregiver more than a girlfriend.
3.	⁠We have very different parenting styles. He needs a lot of rest during the day as he struggles to get regular sleep at night. That means he is hands off a lot of the time. (I am not) He also does not discipline in ways I feel are appropriate or effective. His child is unruly, yells a lot, does not use appropriate language with adults and is very impulsive. I know this will create a lot of tension in our relationship if we are unable to agree.
4.	⁠I don’t know his ex well but I already don’t like her. I don’t feel like that’s something I want to deal with for another 10+ years.

Re-reading this myself I know what I would say to me: End it.

I just love him very much and need validation. Even if that comes from strangers on the internet. What I want and what I need are two different things.

Do you stand behind your choice or regret it?","I understand that this is a difficult decision for you, and it's important to consider all aspects before making a final choice. Regarding your concerns about independence and the potential caregiver role, have you tried discussing these issues with your partner and seeing if there's a compromise that could work for both of you?

"Location: Florida

Yesterday, I met someone to give them a dog I've been trying to rehome. Things went well, and she seemed to like the dog and decided to move forward. She had a friend there that was a bit sketchy. All the info she had of me was an email, and my middle name. We emailed afterwards answering a couple questions: when's his birthday, how much to feed him, etc. Fast forward to today, I checked my email and there was nothing so I assumed she was doing good with the dog. I laid down to take a nap(we have a newborn), and was woken up by my wife saying two women were beating on our door. I was a bit disoriented(you know when you get woken up abruptly), and checked the nest. It was her. I was confused, we met at another location, and she had no info about me. I didn't answer, she told the nest camera she wanted to give the dog back. Then they left.

In the span of about 15 min, they leave messages on both mine and my wife's phones(numbers I didn't give them), and show up my work demanding I take the dog back(I'm on vacation). At this point I'm still confused and a little angry lol. I'm pretty non confrontational and at the same time my brother showed up. Half of me just wanted to call them back and just go get the dog, but the other half of me want nothing to do with people that show up to my job uninvited, much less my home. Before I could think through it, my brother texted and said it he was house sitting and that we were out of town lol, and that it was inappropriate that they showed up to my work. She texted back saying she doesn't want the dog because she's going to lose her apartment if she keeps it.

Is it kind of psycho that they tracked me down, found my job, and then showed up unannounced, or am I being paranoid? I gave them a bunch of dog stuff and dog food. I think one of the boxes had a address label on it and that's how they got it, but I'm not sure. Can I just ignore them, and possible file a incident report if they show up again?","I'm really sorry to hear about the unexpected situation with the woman and the dog. It's important to clarify a few things before coming to any conclusions.

Have you considered contacting her directly to try and understand why she wants to return the dog? It might be helpful to get some clarity on her reasons and intentions. Additionally, you mentioned that she had some of your contact information, but not your address. How did she obtain your work information?

"So here I am again.

My dad is back in the ER. I’m about to go out to sit with him. This may be it.

He has eaten since I made him a single scrambled egg Monday night. Hasn’t been able. Been barely keeping ice chips down. He’s so so weak.

I don’t want this to be the end. Or the beginning of the end - hospice, you know?

But also, I don’t want him to be in pain and miserable so I hope if this is the end it’s not drawn out and terrible for him.

I, selfishly, want him to bounce back.

I, selfishly, don’t want him to die.

I, logically, want his body to do whatever is best for him, and if that means he needs to die now, then I understand that’s what’s best and don’t want him to suffer further.

I, selfishly, hate the logical side of myself and think that part of me is uncaring and lacks empathy.

I, logically, know that this side of me is full of caring and empathy and just don’t want to see him suffer.

I was screaming FUCK GODDAMN IT SHIT FUCKING WHY!? in my car on my way home from work while we were waiting on the details of where the ambulance was taking him. I put my car in fucking +reverse+ instead of 1st gear on accident and it’s good I eased onto the accelerator because I only backed up inches and course corrected. I haven’t ever done that before. I know where reverse is. I know where 1st gear is. I’ve been driving a goddamn standard transmission since I was 18.

I hate this situation so much.

I hate that we (collectively as humans) have to go through this sort of loss.

I hate that I’m having to go through this sort of loss.

I love my dad so much.

Okay. I’ve gotten this at least out into the universe. Time to change into not work clothes and drive out to the hospital until ??? tonight and sit with him.

"Ok listen, this is not a religious rant at all. This is a rant about people, especially men, because they’re usually the one proposing marriage, fundamentally misunderstanding the point of a marriage. Marriage is not about love, it’s not about sex, or family, or kids. Marriage is about legal protection for both parties.

I have this friend who’s been dating this guy for 5 years. While I really like this guy and I think he’s genuinely a great dude, he won’t marry her, and I think it’s clear by now he never will. This rant is not about “why buy the cow when you get the milk for free” or whatever. He’s about to go into surgery tomorrow, a relatively minor operation that should go fine. However, his parents live clear across the country in another time zone and they aren’t on good terms. If something happens tomorrow, there will be no one to make any tough calls. My friend was shocked to learn this and??? Why are you surprised? Do people think gay couples fought so hard for marriage because equality and rainbows! No! They fought so their partners wouldn’t have to die alone in a cold hospital room, so that there would be someone to make those tough end of life decisions, so that someone who loves them and knows their wishes can make hard choices on their behalf. Marriage is a binding legal contract that ensures your partner receives your assets upon your death so they can rebuild their life from scratch, it ensures there’s going to be someone who respects your wishes making hard medical calls on your behalf, damn, in some cases a marriage is the difference between life and death! I’m just so frustrated watching them and watching couples like them who don’t get it. It doesn’t matter how much you love your partner or how long you’ve been dating, or if you have kids together. Without that sheet of paper and those over priced pieces of metal on your fingers, your relationship doesn’t mean jack shit in the medical or legal world.","I understand where you're coming from, and I agree that legal protections are important in a relationship. But have you considered the potential benefits of drawing up a power of attorney or health care proxy instead of getting married? These legal documents allow someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf in case of an emergency or incapacitation, regardless of your relationship status. It's an alternative option worth exploring for those who may not be ready for marriage but still want to ensure their loved ones are empowered to act in their best interests.",neutral

"So there is a lot here for context, I'll my best to run through most of it. A year ago, my dad, who is around 50, ran off with a 26 year old. For context, I am 29. His stated reason for doing so was my stepmother's abuse. She could at times be horribly emotionally abusive and bordered on physically abusing us at times. However, this doesn't really mean anything because Dad could and should have separated from her, and then ran off with someone else, not the other way around. 

All of this put me in a sticky situation, where I tackled mixed feelings over it all. However, I tried to choose peace. I told her that she was still my second mom and that anything between them wouldn't change that. I showed up for birthdays and holidays and NEVER one-time commented on a single aspect of what was happening between them. I just keep reinforcing she and my younger siblings (15-16) would always be my family. During this time, I only ever got calls or texts from my stepmom that were meant to hurt my father. Her and the kids stopped buying me gifts. 

Mother's day arrived this year, and I tried to call her to see if I could visit. She didn't answer. I texted a nice message, she read it and did not respond. I called her mom and asked her to have my stepmom call me, and she never did. Fast forward to yesterday, and my Dad asked to go see the new fantastic 4 with him. I said yes, and he asked her if my little brother wanted to come with. She asked him who he was going with, and he said to me, and she said no. He's never allowed to see them again.

Idk what happened. I go to college 30 hours a week and work another 30. There have been no misunderstandings, no cold words, and no issues of any sort that she discussed with me or others around me. The best guess I have is I've gone to my Dad's new place a couple of times where he is living with his new woman, and she feels betrayed. 

Bless anyone who actually read this. I'm hurt that someone I thought was a mother figure to me was so quick to cast me to the side and block me off from seeing my siblings. No phone calls to discuss issues we, I guess, have. And to go the extra mile and keep me from maintaining relationships with my siblings is cruel and makes me wonder why she'd go so far to hurt me. Makes me wonder what's she's telling them is the reason I can't come out. She tells them horrible things about my father. To further complicate it, she called my dad's job and tried to get him fired, so I'm afraid to even reach out to figure out what happened. It's all so sad.

"Hi. 

I'm writing here becuase I'm unable to sleep. 

Its been 6 months since my last update, I'm now almost 8 months pregnant and my daughter is 5 now. She is a sweetheart.  

My last months have been rough.  Life is beating me up like if I was the one who stole baby Jesus' pacifier.  

My ex was very respectful the very few weeks. He came regularly to pick our daughter, put his share of money, was attentive with me and I thought whoa, maybe this is going to hurt like hell for a long time but its gonna work. My mom and my sister were great! I swear this pregnancy has been easy, sometimes I forget I'm pregnant. 

I FOUND out the reason of Eliza and ex fallout. And learned it directly from Eliza's mouth. She called me one day and say she would like some words. I wasn't sure but we met. She said she wanted to apologize for a couple of things: not realizing _how_ badly intrusive she was in my marriage (she knew she was but did not realized how bad it was and how toxic). Enjoying the influece she has on my husband. Knowing he would do as she pleased gave her a sense of control she didn't have in her life. And she apologized for all the pain she caused me. 

We are no friends or anything. I'm trying my best to no hate her but I'm glad that finally my feelings and insecurities were validated. 

*On their fallout out* Apparently when my ex was sleeping with a friend, at some point between when he left the house and when he returned begging to save our family; 2 male friends, Eliza and my ex where having drinks, they were drunk but no wasted. Eliza went outside to smoke and my followed her and tried to kiss her, she rejected him, asked what the fuck and my ex went all romantic about the fire he felt for her, he was full of fire for her. It was always her. She laughed and called him patetic. 

She told me that so I know exactly what kind man he is. 

Now the rough part, after a couple of weeks he started to press again for being together. One day he was being so agresive about it that when I said I would die first before being with him he grabbed me by my arm  and left a mark. 

He basically disappeared. He isnt helping with child support and I'm alone paying for everything.  I'm really struggling.  

When I do see him he mocks me saying we could live better if we were together. 

I'm so glad I dont love him anymore. ","I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you've faced in your personal life. It sounds like a difficult situation, and I can understand why you might be feeling overwhelmed.

"Looong read

I M51) haven't had alcohol or weed in years. From late teens to early twenties, I was a weekend binge drinker. Plain old 5% beer. During the week I didn't drink and it never crossed my mind. If for some reason I did not go out on the weekend, then I didn't drink either. Once I stopped going out that was it, no more beer. In my early to mid twenties I tried some weed and fell in love. It was like an amplifier! Music was better, movies were better, it just felt amazing. I quit several times, usually for a few years and for various reasons. I got married about 20 years ago, and everything was great for the first 10 or so years. But after that it declined and I wasn't happy and neither was she, so I started weed again. And that snowballed to the point where I wanted to smoke whenever I had a chance. Drinking was very sporadic until I started hanging out with coworkers after work. I'm ashamed to admit I drove home with a blood alcohol level that was over the limit on more than one occasion. I got a divorce and started seeing someone else; neither went very well. I eventually stopped smoking weed but by doing so, I increased my alcohol intake. I guess I needed something. Beer, IPAs in the 5-8% range, or red wine were my go to. It ended my relationship, I bought a house, kept drinking and restarted weed, and before long work was starting to suffer. So I decided to seek help and have been clean ever since. Like I said I'm 51 now. I can't say I have cravings. Ice cream or pizza sure, weed or alcohol not really. But I so miss the occasions where I'm sitting on the porch with a beer or a a joint (well bowl usually). I thonk it's more the yhought of it than anything else. I know I can never have either again though and that sucks. I have stopped listening to a lot of music and stopped walking a lot of movies because they are just not as exiting withoud weed.

"I’m going to start by providing context to this situation. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, and for the first year he was living independently, had drive, and had a good job. This all went downhill when he moved back in with his mother in October of last year. Originally this was going to be temporary until my lease was up in April and then we were planning on moving in together. Shortly after he moved back into his mom’s house, he ended up quitting his job and getting a seasonal job at a ski resort for the winter. I ended up asking him about moving in together again and he informed me that we would not in fact be moving in together because he wanted to live rent free and save money. Which I understand not wanting to pay rent for a while as a young person, but it definitely annoyed me a bit considering that meant I had to figure out a different living situation now that we weren’t moving in together. Anyways, fast forward to now, he’s still working seasonal, making not very much money, and still living with his mom. At this point, I’m starting to get really turned off by the lack of drive he appears to have to get any sort of plan for a more stable, better paying job. Or just any sort of plan to get into a better financial situation. He won’t move out of his mom’s house because he doesn’t want to pay for anything, he always asks me to Venmo him if he pays for our food, and he can’t stick to any of the plans he makes for figuring out a career. I feel like sometimes I’m just nitpicking, because he is slightly younger than me and his brain is less developed. He also is in a situation where no one is pushing him to be responsible but me. Our family dynamics are completely different, I’m expected to be 100% self sufficient including paying for my own health and car insurance and phone bill. His only responsibility is paying for his car. So I guess it’s just really hard for me to wrap my head around being almost 23 years old and not having any plan to establish stability. I’m not sure if this is something that will change as he gets a little older or if he’ll just always be this way? And I can’t help but feel frustrated because he wasn’t this way the first year of us being together, it all just changed after he moved back in with his mom. I’m not sure if I should keep waiting it out or if I should just end things. I’m in a place in my life where I’m building a lot of things for myself and I have a lot of drive to establish stability for myself, and I want a partner that also has that drive for themselves. I want to be taken care of by my partner just as much as I’m taking care of them, and right now it just feels like I’m mothering this man. I’m not sure what to do, I constantly go back and forth about it. Please, if you made it this far and have any advice let me know. ","I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're experiencing in your relationship. It's understandable that the change in circumstances and your boyfriend's apparent lack of drive towards stability may be concerning for you. Have you tried having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns? You mentioned that he may be in a different family dynamic and that his brain might not be fully developed yet. It might be helpful to discuss how these factors are affecting his decision-making and whether there are any potential solutions or compromises that could be explored?

"I (M45) have come out of a long term relationship, 20 years, and have two young kids and work full time, so I’m reasonably busy. I like my work and my kids so don’t need financial or child minding help.

"It's a very long story, which I won't bore you with, but our neighbor has been stirring up trouble for us, more intensely the last two-three weeks. Late last night, she and her friend let loose a couple of screeds in my messenger  and text bbox. 

I know some of what she said is true. But I have spent the last decades of my life taken care of my parents. Dad passed in late 2019, and it's been Mom and I ever since. She currently has neuropathy and lymphoma and is beginning with very light dementia.  I am responsible for pretty much everything. We do live in  poverty or close to it; I've never checked. 

Despite what our neighbor said, I/we have tried to fix what she's complaining about. Last year we were scammed out of $7k+, for example, trying to do just that, for the umpteenth time.  I have begged and pleaded multiple people multiple times for help with cleaning, both here and my grandparents old house, bought by Mom & Dad from Grandpa before he passed. No every time. 

We should be hearing from the scheduler at the hospital soon for Mom. 

I usually feel down and overwhelmed and hopeless, those wotfd bidn't help any. I'm not suicidal, but I could get there. I talked to someone earlier this week about groups and events I might try out.  

I know we need to have more income coming in. I know prices are going up. I know we need to eat better, and so on. We have insurance and taxes coming up, etc. We need security here. We need yard work, but I also need to take care of Mom. She's not that bad yet, but I drive her back and forth as we, no real alt transportation at this time. 

I'm at the end of my rope. We have cut back. We eat very cheap food, which really isn't good for her, too much sodium. We don't get clothes, even 2nd hand, very oftren. We can't even afford the $75 annual library card.

I could go on. I've done/am doing the best I can, and it's not enough.  I feel like a bunch of bad stuff is going to all come crashing down on me - and it's not going to end as well as Mom thinks it is. 

She's the eternal optimist.  I'm not. I'm scared.  I know what our neighbor could do, what she's subtly threatening to do.

Mom's going with me to the police this time.  For moral support, but also to show she isn't being abused. Then we have to go do the wash, and hopefully get home before it gets blazing hot. 

If any of the above strikes a chord, please give me/us support and/or advice. 

Thank you.

"TLDR: Rant about how distressing it is to go from healthy to bedbound/disabled in 1 month with no clear solution or timeline to healing.



On June 4 I got 1 night of stuffy nose, high fever, and chills followed by an extremely painful sore throat for 4 days. I thought it was the flu, or just a cold, I didn't even consider COVID nor test for anything. When those symptoms stopped, I slept 12+ hours a day but just chalked it up to being my usual laziness/depression. So I decided to go on a hike to ""kickstart my body with exercise!"" (what an absolutely ableist idea!!), during which the brain fog was so severe and I was so breathless, but I pushed through. 2 days later I crashed so hard, experienced 2 bouts of horrifying tachycardia (I thought I was dying). I also noticed I had histamine intolerance symptoms after eating soy. I started on a Long COVID research rabbit hole and convinced myself I had CFS because the crash seemed like PEM. This was the start of being housebound.

  
Then I underwent multiple major stressors which made the fatigue and insomnia worse, to the point I could not get out of bed unassisted. For the insomnia and panic, I was prescribed multiple different benzos, which I used for 3-4 weeks, but now I think I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I've bought all sorts of supplements which I've found through this Reddit and the TREATME study, I use them with the fear I'll react negatively, or it'll make me worse. I went to the ER and from the tests they ran, there's nothing wrong with me that stands out.

My body is so heavy, even when lying down. My sinuses seem to be permanently inflamed. At least my brain works, but it's difficult to focus for long periods of time. My heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure have lost all rhyme or reason. My brain doesn't shut down to sleep, and when I wake up it's always from some twisted dream. I feel like I'm no longer a human being but just an experiment. Trying acupuncture, trying Chinese medicinal herbs, trying this or that. I pin my hopes on (another) Stellate Ganglion Block, or that right now it's mostly benzo withdrawal and it will ease in 6 weeks. I ruminate too much, which makes me suffer more.

  
My mind is just filled with medical anxiety, fear that this is the start of chronic illness, fear that my body is permanently ruined. That no medicine nor doctor can help me. I've already lost 10% of my body weight which is entirely basic function muscle. (I was only 52kg/114 pounds to begin with)

  
I try to see the positives. I'm not so lifeless that I can't get out of bed anymore. I live somewhere with a perfect climate and next to nature so I can lay outside and watch the birds and butterflies. I haven't experienced a crash from my new, slightly improved activity levels, so no CFS (yet) haha!!

  
The only thing that is 80% guaranteed to heal me is time, but the time does not easily pass when I have no long-lasting reasons to be happy, when I'm hot most of the time, uncomfortable 98% of the time, when I can't even nap to escape the situation. Even simple online games I loved playing don't feel satisfying anymore. Staying sane is an active effort.

I can't imagine the strength of everyone here who's been fighting with this for months, years. I don't even qualify for the 3+ month definition for Long COVID yet.

I see many men here in their 40s hitting a similar ""wall"" and I wonder if ADHD + midlife crisis hits us even more hard compared to people without ADHD?

With ADHD, as long as I have a goal (career, hobby, relationships) - I can go after it (yepp, often hyperfixate on it) and it keeps me going for a while...

But now, it seems like I have fullfilled all the goals and... not sure how to describe it... ""lost the ability to dream""? I mean my dreams (like to live in a small house somewhere near a forest/lake, away from busy cities) are not very ""compatible"" with my family, so I don't go after them...

And goals like a new car, bigger house or more money don't motivate me anymore...

Now I value my ""holy peace"" time more than anything...  
Spending time in nature, walking/rucking a lot to allow my mind to ""wander"" and clear out...

Any other guys in the 40s feeling similar?

"I never ever thought I’d be the person who could make a steak at home, but last night I pulled it off!

"I am on birth control our primary method of contraception. I take the depo shot every 12 weeks. I usually get it delivered from the pharmacy because it’s easier for me. Ive been doing this for over 3 years. And yes, I know the concerns for being on it this long. My gyno is looking out for me. But the delivery has always come on time so I can get it injected at the doctor’s office. But this time, it didn’t. 

I am currently in a battle with the pharmacy, my insurance, and I think uber? My prescription was picked up but it’s been “out for delivery” for days. So I think a driver has it, but they are keeping it. It’s been 5 days now, I am late, no one wants to refund me. I might have to pay for a new vial myself. Also if it gets delivered, idk what conditions it was in. I don’t want to take the risk of the driver doing something to it. So I want a new vial. 

But anyways, I am late on my birth control and I told my partner we can have sex, but only with condoms. I even bought some. But he won’t use them. He says pulling out is fine and I can go over 12 weeks on the depo shot

I am not ok with that. We are both child free. I know he doesn’t want kids and he’d also be a bad dad. I think he’s letting his lust get in the way. I don’t want to take the risk. He knows I’d get an abortion if I was pregnant. But also I won’t have unprotected sex and risk getting pregnant and then abort. If I am not protected by my shot, I won’t have sex. 

He wants to trust himself with pullout instead of use condoms. I won’t have that? How can I get him to understand that I didn’t cause this and he cannot have sex with me without a condom?

"I need an advice. 
I'm a 33F single but I'm still in contact with the 34M I met from hinge less than 2 months ago. We only met once, he is currently living in a remote area for work which is 10hrs away from me. 

SITUATION:
We're on the same page on long distance relationship  that we can't go into it because both of us just got out of it. 
We flirted before we first met but afterwards I told him that I would like to be friends with him because it felt like I would lose contact with after that day. The only way I thought to keep in touch with him is to ask him to be a friend. 
He agreed and after that we still talk like we used to but without the flirting. 

HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM:
At first, I don't feel anything but greedy not to let him go because of his genuine actions and behavior. 

Now I think I'm starting to feel something for him. I suddenly felt I miss him today and would like to see him. I don't know if this would just keep developing. 

DILEMMA:
He will in my location next next month for 4 months. We agreed to met if when he arrived my feelings for him developed. 

Should I confess knowing that there a chance he might reject me? or keep the relationship but slowly die inside. 
In summary my choices are instant death or  slow death + torture. 🥲 haha

FANTASY:
If he is wanted me also, I'll be in a ldr again for him and will try to visit him.

"For context, my father is Muslim and my mother is anti-religion. Don’t ask me how they came to marry. They’re long divorced and my father has now found his ideal Islamic family. From my stepmother I now have 7 step siblings, ranging from 14-32. 

Long story short he happened to meet them for the first time this week and I did tell him they’d be in traditional wear, that my father might even be wearing a “dress” (thawb) with the women wearing hijabs and abayas. On the way back to our town he mentioned wishing i could dress more modest like they do and asked if i could. I thought this was weird and noted, “if you want someone who dresses like a Muslim you should date a Muslim.”

he didn’t like this answer. I don’t even dress immodestly like that, i was shamed for wearing skinny jeans as a kid. im very overly attentive to what i wear and how it makes me look.

"I was diagnosed probably 2 years ago and started taking meds immediately. I also do a lot of independent research so I can fully understand all of my symptoms. Lately, I have been feeling like my ADHD paralysis has gotten worse. It's really only on the days where I take a break from my meds. Before I was diagnosed I had a lot of problems getting up and starting tasks, but I could still do it after I had a brief fight with my brain. Now, on days off of my meds, sometimes I don't get out of bed until noon and I maybe do 1 or 2 tasks. I've been trying to research this and haven't found many resources so I thought I would turn here. I think sometimes community and life experiences can be more useful than scientific research anyway.

"It's a very long story, which I won't bore you with, but our neighbor has been stirring up trouble for us, more intensely the last two-three weeks. Late last night, she and her friend let loose a couple of screeds in my messenger  and text bbox. 

I know some of what she said is true. But I have spent the last decades of my life taken care of my parents. Dad passed in late 2019, and it's been Mom and I ever since. She currently has neuropathy and lymphoma and is beginning with very light dementia.  I am responsible for pretty much everything. We do live in  poverty or close to it; I've never checked. 

Despite what our neighbor said, I/we have tried to fix what she's complaining about. Last year we were scammed out of $7k+, for example, trying to do just that, for the umpteenth time.  I have begged and pleaded multiple people multiple times for help with cleaning, both here and my grandparents old house, bought by Mom & Dad from Grandpa before he passed. No every time. 

We should be hearing from the scheduler at the hospital soon for Mom. 

I usually feel down and overwhelmed and hopeless, those wotfd bidn't help any. I'm not suicidal, but I could get there. I talked to someone earlier this week about groups and events I might try out.  

I know we need to have more income coming in. I know prices are going up. I know we need to eat better, and so on. We have insurance and taxes coming up, etc. We need security here. We need yard work, but I also need to take care of Mom. She's not that bad yet, but I drive her back and forth as we, no real alt transportation at this time. 

I'm at the end of my rope. We have cut back. We eat very cheap food, which really isn't good for her, too much sodium. We don't get clothes, even 2nd hand, very oftren. We can't even afford the $75 annual library card.

I could go on. I've done/am doing the best I can, and it's not enough.  I feel like a bunch of bad stuff is going to all come crashing down on me - and it's not going to end as well as Mom thinks it is. 

She's the eternal optimist.  I'm not. I'm scared.  I know what our neighbor could do, what she's subtly threatening to do.

Mom's going with me to the police this time.  For moral support, but also to show she isn't being abused. Then we have to go do the wash, and hopefully get home before it gets blazing hot.

"Hello r/GetMotivated,

As I (21F) mentioned in the title, I cannot really grasp the concept of enjoying the process of achieving goals. I just achieve goals, no matter how I do it. If i really need it, and if the effort is worth the goal for me, I do it, or if it's not worth it, I don't. I have ADHD and autism (if it's important)

I'll give couple of examples below

1. I work as a software developer intern. I do my job to get the money and to validate my university year (it's a requirement). I couldn't care less about the enjoyment of what I'm doing, I just know that I have to do it so that I finish my year and get my monthly pay. I'm not happy with the pay, but this was the highest paid internship.

How can I even enjoy the process of working, when the only thing I wish for is money to then be able to do what I actually like? It's not like I dislike IT: I've liked it ever since I was a child, and I still do it as a hobby sometimes, but ugh... How do you enjoy if it's work? I doubt anyone would've enjoyed flipping burgers in McDonald's or something. It's just work

2. I like to play games, but as soon as they become challenging, I stop playing. It feels like a waste of time and effort to try to win a game that's too challenging. Winning too easy is not enjoyable too, but it feels much better than always losing while trying to do the impossible.

Like, I have no idea why do I hate losing so much.

3. I hate to walk. I'm in good health, but walking feels like such a waste of time. People always associate ""enjoying the process"" with walking, ""taking a stroll"", that it feels nice and so. I've broken my brain trying to understand what they meant, because for me walking is just the thing that gets me from point A to point B, nothing more. Maybe I'll see something interesting around, but I for sure would NEVER go out without a reason, just to take a walk. I always HAVE to have a reason to go out: go grocery shopping, go get that board game, go eat out, etc., or else I will feel like I'm spending the time I have left on this planet on something that doesn't make me feel good. I even taught myself to make wider steps at some point, so I would spend as less time en-route as possible

It feels like my brain is trying to maximise the dopamine from doing as little effort as possible. While it's only natural, it feels like it's extreme, compared to other people, even people with ADHD. Everything has to be optimised, or I'd hate it.

I'm on my second psychologist now, and it seems like they cannot help me to find the reason why I'm feeling like this, despite helping me immensely with other things. 

If I want something, I'll do effort to get it, if it's not too much effort and if I'll get more dopamine than negative emotions from the hard path of achieving the goal. I have no trouble doing boring and mundane things, I always do them. My house is not always clean, but is for sure clean when I'm determined to make it clean.

The reason why I want to understand what's really ""enjoying the process"" is because I'm starting to realise that I could enjoy my life more than I actually do, but I don't know how.

I've always been like this. I don't have TikTok or other video scrolling apps like that, I prefer reading long articles over watchign a video of someone explaining them, etc. I don't have a problem focusing on anything

"Hi everyone! This is my first post ever, eek!

I'm F34 and started to seek diagnosis last year for something that can only be ADHD based on the trail of chaos I've left behind since birth. Either that or BPD, but anyway - I've started the journey of understanding my brain a little better with the help of a professional. Only I've realized I'm not sure what I'm really after if I get a diagnosis.

As we all know, in addition to the main course of ADHD, there's many fun side dishes too, and in my case I suffer from (health-)anxiety and I'm afraid to take medications because of side effects. I started wondering if I could ever take ADHD medication. The only ""safe"" meds for me are over the counter painkillers, and my brain has decided they will have to help me with anything that comes my way, because I get severe anxiety about anything else. But that's another matter.

ANYWAY, I got a bit sidetracked (surprised?) but my question is - is there anyone here that is _NOT_ on any ADHD meds (as I feel like literally everyone is on some sort) and why? How do you cope? Do you self-medicate? Or do you just leave it be? Many thanks for any contributions <3

I'm not diagnosed with ADHD, but I've had friends and family members who have gone through the process.

"I (30M) have a younger brother (26M) who was born with severe physical and cognitive disabilities. Growing up, everything in our household revolved around him, appointments, therapies, meltdowns, accommodations. I was the “normal” kid, expected to understand and adjust.

And I did. On the outside. But inside? I hated it.

I hated missing birthday parties because he couldn’t handle crowds. I hated that my parents forgot to come to my school play because he had a seizure that day. I hated that I never got to be seen.

There were nights I wished he’d never been born. I’m ashamed to admit it. I’ve never said that out loud until now.

To put it bluntly, my arm started hurting  and it was clear, to me, that it was due to the infusion going into a too small vein too fast. I've experienced this before. It hurts, a lot. Stoping it involves either reducing the flow or moving the site to a bigger vein.

But, no matter how many times I explained this to the nurse, she kept bringing up burning sensations being normal for some chemo drugs. She didn't seem to want to hear ""there's no burning sensation.""

Her ""solutions"" were 1)add saline to the mix, 2)add a much lower volume of saline to the mix, and 3)add a second line in my other hand, in about the same spot as the line that's giving me problems, and run different drugs in there.

She got annoyed and left, with a parting ""I'll come back when you've decided what you want to do"", when I wouldn't let her do 3.

"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","I'm curious, what are the specific circumstances that lead people to invite or accept private conversations early on in a thread about mental health support? Is there a particular situation where this approach might be more beneficial than responding publicly? I'd love to hear more about the experiences and perspectives of others on this topic.",neutral

"Location: LakewoodVillage, Tx 
So, I am in Texas, which is a one party recording state. 
My neighbor ( let’s call him Runk) is friends with the city secretary ( we will call her Lindy). She sees herself as the city czar ( the city is like 20 streets). 
The neighbor has been angry with me for not receiving his advice for about a year and a half, and so he keeps making claims that are unsubstantiated just to be an ass. 
The city czar ( Lindy) has now had the city launch multiple law suits against me, claiming I have dogs getting out (dogs that are not mine, and the only person they can say can testify they are is Runk. They want like $1500. 
When I was sitting in the office for the second “pre trial” ( which was just another attempt to bully me into paying), I watched Lindy, the city prosecutor ( also a judge in a neighboring county, which I believe is illegal) and the judge go into a room first and I could overhear them talking and laughing, saying they were going to deny my request for whatever “evidence “ they thought they had. I also requested a video from inside of city hall, and they were laughing saying they were going to say there was no audio from the video and deny it. ( yes, I am aware this is also ex parte communication). 
So, as I was sitting there, I started recording the conversation from the room I was sitting in as evidence that they were intending to deny me a copy of my own evidence. 
It has been 4 months and suddenly today I received a phone call from the county sheriff’s office asking if I had recorded a conversation within city hall that I was not a party to. I did explain what happened and he said he was going to call back after deciding I had committed a crime. 
Was it illegal for me to record a conversation inside of a city hall I pay for ( so part ownership) that was about me, and to be used as evidence, even though I was not an active party?

Have you considered consulting with a lawyer to understand the specific laws regarding recording conversations in public buildings, particularly those that you partially own or pay for?

"As you can read from the title, I’ve just finished up my 14th cycle of chemo after recurrence back in November last year. I have done 28 days of radiation and did a pet scan this week so that my doctors can discuss a possible surgery to my spine. It has been a very hard year, and I’m so glad it’s over. However, it’s hitting me in ways that I didn’t expect. 

On my first cycle, I stayed overnight in hospital and I ended up sharing a room with someone who was my age and we both had Ewings. We immediately connected, shared contact info and the rest was history. She was on her first cycle also, so it felt as though we were fighting this thing together as a team. We would share stories about what our days or weeks had been like, any funny stories while we were in the oncology ward, always making sure to visit each others rooms if we were in the ward at the same time. As someone who has had Ewings before, I was able to answer any and all questions she’d have about treatment and hopefully alleviate her anxiety - of which she had a lot. So yeah, we were fighting this thing together and although I would never wish this on anyone, I was glad to have her by my side through this fight. I considered her a very good friend.

Unfortunately, she stopped responding to treatment and passed away around our 10th cycle. I was, and still am, a complete mess. My last 4 cycles of chemo dragged on and felt never ending. Now that it’s finished, I can’t stop crying. I keep thinking about her and how she should be here with me now, celebrating the end of chemo. 

I feel so so exhausted now, everything hit me like a truck now that I’ve finished chemo. Throughout treatment, I kept on working full time, using leave for whenever I was not up for work - typically while I was doing chemo (I wfh for reference). Now that treatment is over, I’m expected to be back at work 40 hours every week and I just don’t know how I can do it. I pushed myself so hard to continue work throughout treatment and now that it’s over I just have to keep going. My ‘prize’ for finishing chemo is more work? I’m scared to leave my job because the job market is so bad right now and I hear stories from everywhere about people not being able to find jobs. I don’t know what to do but I’m not sure I can go on like this. 

Not sure if this sounds entitled but I really don’t want to work, at least right now. I want to go traveling and have new experiences, I feel like I deserve to do this? I might die anyways, I don’t want to be working in my final year of life.

But damn… sometimes being the only one not drunk while everyone’s yelling over each other, forgetting stuff mid-sentence, dancing on tables, it feels like I’m watching a show that once i also used to be a part of lol and now I’m just… there. Aware, Awake and Sober.

And yeah, part of me misses the chaos. The fake confidence. The way I used to not give a shit. But the other part of me, the one that remembers the 3 a.m. anxiety spirals and blackouts knows I’m better off.

Still. Doesn’t make those moments any easier. There are moments where i am just moments closer to relapse, still try to hold that urge and I amd proud of those days!

"For background, my family has an endless history with Alzheimers/dementia. I watched my grandmother, grandfather, and 2 aunts pass from it. My mom is the remaining person in her immediate family alive, 70 years old. She has 2 APOE4 genes and as she has aged I've obviously been watching for signs, I think I'm watching it unfold and I need some advice.

She's been battling cancer for about 3 years, initially pancreatic cancer, which was caught early enough to go through a tumor removal surgery (whipple, very difficult). She also did rounds of chemo and radiation. Through this battle, she had times where stomach bile backed up into her brain and made her memory bad, we thought this would clear up once the bile could pass through her system after tumor removal. She also had very bad case of hospital delirium after surgery. Chemo ALSO added to the memory impairment. I've been waiting for a long time now to see if it was the cancer, surgery or chemo impacting her short term memory and if it would improve. It did a little but her memory has continued to be an issue. She did have a brain MRI in Sept. 2024 to check for cancer, not sure if this is a good baseline or if they would have seen something then?

She recently went through a traumatic break up with her partner of 15 years in the last few weeks and she has declined extremely fast. 2 weeks ago, we could carry on a conversation pretty well, now there is a lot of agitation and defensiveness, this is the most concerning part. I feel a little ridiculous looking back and I think I kept blaming all the cancer effects. She's now alone at her home, I'm scrambling to put together the reality of her state. Her home is covered in sticky notes, she has all these ""systems"" she is attempting to use. Myself, her friends and her neighbors nearby are all using terms like, she's having a good/bad day, to check in everyday. She told me the other day she's having a good day because she knows where her bedroom is, but then the next day, she can kinda keep the facade up.

"So, I'll try to safe you the whole 'woe is me' story, but some details are important. 

>Due to some trauma related mental health issues, as well as my upbringing leaving out a big chunk of the social spectrum (I believe my dad has pretty low EQ, and my mum has hella issues), dating has always felt like lifting above my weight. What didn't help was that around the time I started liking girls, my self-esteem was at an all time low, and being bullied a lot, I didn't really dare to tell someone I liked them. This I eventually overcame (in the most awkwardly adorable way), but it did set the tone for my dating experience trough-out my 20's. Long story short; there where some really nice, but mostly awful experiences, and a lot of 'what's wrong wit me'-flavored loneliness. A couple years ago I took a break from dating to do some mental health work, something I'm still working on, although I'm proud to boast considerable progress. 

  
I'm excited to return to dating as soon as I feel I'm ready enough to start dating from a constructive place. I feel like I can be a better (more sane) partner, and I feel like I'm (almost) sensible enough to start dating from a place of mutual respect, rather than defeatism and bitterness. I'd really like to break that cycle. and go on dates and feel like it's 2 people getting to know each other, rather than me begging for scraps. I want to make a move on someone and feel like I have half a clue of what I'm doing, maybe even enjoy the chase. Flirt a bit, maybe have a fun fling, maybe not. 

And who knows, maybe fall desperately in love. Although I'm ok if that doesn't happen. I'm no longer looking for someone to save me :) 

Thing is, excited as I am, I have hella cold feet about getting back on that horse. I have some pleasant experiences to guide me, but also 20odd years of fear and loathing looming over my shoulder. On top of that, the current discourse on dating seems so full of stigma these days, that I've struggled to find some genuine support. Even amongst my friends. I'm really not sure where and how to approach finding and going on dates without feeling insecure about the lack of experience I have, or the position in Iife I'm expected to be at. (eg I have no short term interest in planning a happily ever after, especially the one with rings and home-grown poop-monsters).

"I went out on just a couple dates with someone. He ghosted me when I wasn’t able to meet as often as he’d like (we were meeting weekly) as I had let him know i had just gotten out of something and I needed time to process everything (EDIT: I said this because i was being asked to commit to being exclusive the next week). He came back and apologized a month later saying he could sense my “disinterest” (meanwhile i had made clear my interest - despite hesitation of doing so so early- multiple time during the dates) and I said its ok but I was surprised he felt that way because I was beyond transparent even though it felt hard to be so transparent so early in dating (early dating should be light and fun). I tried to ask how he was doing but he ghosted again. Perhaps because he again thought i was not interested.

So i gave it sometime and did something I wish someone had done for me when i had been insecure in the past and jumped the gun of someones “interest” - i sent him a text letting him know it was too much too soon when he questioned my interest during those dates. That id be open to reconnecting but only if our paces align- because our paces feel mismatched.  He replied that he would be open too and he acknowledged his issues on making it heavy early on. When i assured him ive done the same in the past and then i tried to keep it light again by asking about his going ons… silence which i dont mind - i dont care if someone ghosts like that.

"I've been out of the dating game for 3+ years due to a health issue. I'd like to get back soon. Before that, I was almost exclusively trying to meet women through the apps. I definitely struggle with viewing women as wanting to be left alone almost all of the time in every scenario. I consider myself a socially-adjusted guy, I have plenty of friends, hobbies, a home, I'm well-groomed and in decent shape... not bragging about this, just giving a baseline so everyone's aware I'm not an isolated weirdo wearing unwashed sweatpants and an Anime t-shirt, living at home with mom.

But every time I'm out and see someone I'm attracted to, I can't push myself to go say hi. And I'm not talking walking up to someone on the street on the way to work, but even in shared, relaxed situations, like a concert, bar, or park. It's especially bad if it's in a male-dominated event like a comic-con or a sporting event, because I assume I'll just be guy #108 ruining their time out.

What's eating at me today is that I was playing Pokemon Go in the park this morning with a bunch of people for an event. A woman just my type, appropriate age range, also there by herself with her dog, was hanging out and playing. To make a long story short, looking for one in-game thing, we ended up reasonably by ourselves in a nice shaded area, just hanging out. For at least half an hour.

I didn't say a damn word to her. We had a shared hobby, I could have asked to pet her dog, asked her if she was having any luck catching Pokemon, anything. I just froze and concentrated on the game, and even when she walked off to catch a Pokemon I was about to walk to, I sat there and waited because I worried she'd think I was following her. And I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable just enjoying her hobby and fresh air.

I just froze because I didn't want to ruin her day. I guess my question here is... was that an appropriate place to get to chatting with her? Would I have ruined her day or scared her as a single woman in the park? Should I have talked to her? What should I have said?

 I’m 35 F and my ex is 39M. We were together 6 years.

After texting admin stuff, he was super warm and friendly and also hinting at the fact he is single now (and “old”). I know getting back with your ex is seen as a bad thing but without getting into the details, I do believe we have a chance to make it work.

He asked me so many questions and kind of asked me if I wanted to hang out soon and he wanted to meet my dog. It feels like something is still there and texting him makes me genuinely miss his sense of humour and just him as a person.

"It happened.

I had met the girl of my dreams.

So I had thought.

We met at a military ball, she thought I was cute and gave me her number, and we started dating shortly after. We went a few months together, and we were already sure we were each other's person. We were planning on marriage (not at that moment but eventually), she said she saw me as someone she wanted to spend her life with. To have kids with. To grow old together. We lost our virginity to each other even.

The relationship was good overall, we were there for each other, there were some bumps, but I made sure to communicate. She had issues being expressive or giving effort into the relationship at times due to past trauma. It was one sided emotionally and effort-wise, with me giving most/all the effort. That did hurt me, and we did have conversations where she expressed that I deserved better. Still though, it was something I was willing to work with her on, and she was showing signs of improvement. That was really all ""wrong"" with our relationship. That and my mom didn't approve of her, something that hurt my ex very much. But still.

We were both planning on doing the military together. I had already enlisted, she was going to enlist next year, and we would be co located eventually after marrying. We were confident we could handle the struggle of a military relationship. She stressed she wouldn't quit, that I was worth it, that we could do it. I believed her.

A week or two ago, my gut told me she was getting ready to break up. I always get a vibe, and it's NEVER been wrong. I expressed this concern to her, and I made sure she still wanted me in her future. She assured me. I still felt though things were off.

Last night, we said goodnight. She said she'd talk to me tomorrow, that she misses me, and that she loves me. Then an hour after that (when she supposedly went to sleep), she sent me the text. Here it is:

""So, this sucks because I really hate that I’m doing this to you, but I also admit I’m a coward who doesn’t have the balls to say this shit to your face.

I want the best for you, I hope you achieve all your dreams and goals. As much as it doesn’t seem like it, I really do love you. Bye \[my name\].

Then of course, I was blocked on everything. Just out of the blue. Just like that. All that talk. I'll be there for you. I'm not going to quit. You're worth it. Everything down the drain. I had planned my life with this girl, she wanted me to propose this month. The last time we had seen eachother, maybe a few days ago, we had a nice little date that she planned. We hugged and kissed. We talked and laughed. There was no warning besides my gut.

I immediately reached out to her family. Her family loves me, they consider her apart of the family. They expressed their condolences; they're shocked as much as I am. They think that she's in the wrong. They support me.

All I want is to see her and talk to her face to face and resolve this. If things work out, and we're able to fix it, great. If not, I need closure. I need this last face to face to move on. I expressed this to her family and they advised me to give her space for like a week and hope she reached out, and that they would try talking to her in the meantime.

It's the day after the message and I'm still trying to figure this out. I'm in a state of shock. Everything down the drain. For what? Part of me wants to hate her for doing such a scummy move, but I still love her. I want to talk to her. I'm currently giving her space, and waiting as her family helps me through this.

Plot twist though. I had talked to her sisters, and they actually told me that she's been talking to her exes. They broke into her computer and told me they found her flirting with her exes, planning hangouts, venting about our relationship being ""toxic"" and ""drama filled,"" even having her exes send her money. And I knew about none of this. Apparently she texted an ex the moment she dumped me. Her sisters are disgusted, they also loved me, they're assuring me that I dodged a bullet.

I talked to her mom about that, and she said she's not defending my ex, but that there's a good chance it's not true - apparently her sisters like to stir drama. So we'll see I guess. That's something to consider.

Honestly, I'm putting the military on hold now. My ex is what pushed me to go that route anyways, and I turn 18 in less than a month (which be the way we're both 17) so I want time to enjoy life freely. I want to put myself back together before full sending it.

I'm still in a state of shock. I'm numb and have been crying off and on the whole time. I'm just so confused. If she loves me, and I love her, what reason is there to break up? Maybe it's a self esteem issue with the ""you deserve better""? I have no idea. Then there's the whole potential cheating thing.

At the end of the day, all I want is that face to face. I don't intend for her to get away with text breakup, that is not okay. I feel like a shell of what I was. I feel terribly lonely. It hurts extra because I have trauma myself and had insecurities and fears the whole time, she reassured me on those and RIGHT at the moment I fully believed her, that I fully got over my trust issues and trusted her with my life, did she do this.","I'm really sorry to hear about your breakup and the unexpected turn of events. It must be incredibly difficult for you right now. Have you considered reaching out to her to discuss what happened and why she felt the need to end things suddenly?

"I Spent a lot of time digging into the science behind habits and motivation. Thought I’d share what actually helps people stay consistent:

1. **Progress is the best motivation.** You think you need motivation to start. In reality, you need visible progress to keep going. When you can see that something is working, you want to keep showing up. Think about it. First week in the gym, you're making beginner gains. Reading daily? You feel smarter fast. That early progress pulls you in. But when it slows down, your drive fades. That's when most people quit. James Clear said it best: “The best form of motivation is progress”. This doesn’t have to be complicated. Move paper clips from one pile to another. Tick a to-do list. Use an app. If you’re not tracking it, you’re not feeling it.
2. **Streaks give you something to lose.** When you're building a habit, the hardest part is showing up on the days you don't feel like it. A streak helps with that. It turns a habit into something you're not just building, but protecting. You hit day seven and day eight matters more. Your brain starts seeing the chain, and not breaking it becomes the new goal. It’s simple, but powerful. This is why language apps, fitness trackers, and even snapchat use it. Once you’ve got momentum, consistency stops being a decision and starts being automatic.
3. **Motivation fades. Identity doesn’t.** Telling yourself “I want to work out” works for a little while. But saying “I’m the kind of person who trains” sticks. That shift from action to identity is what makes a habit last. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits: true behaviour change is identity change. When you start acting like the person you want to become, the habit becomes part of your self-image. And once it’s tied to who you are, skipping it feels off. You don’t need constant motivation if the habit reinforces how you see yourself.
4. **You’re not lazy. You just lack structure.** Most people think they have a motivation problem, but what they really have is a systems problem. You’re not broken. You’re just trying to rely on willpower in an environment built for distraction. Setting goals feels productive, but goals don’t get you through hard days. Systems do. A goal might tell you where you want to go, but a system tells you what to do today. James Clear puts it clearly in Atomic Habits: “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” Without structure, your brain defaults to whatever is easiest. That’s not laziness, that’s efficiency. Build systems that guide your day. Waking up earlier, sleeping on time, knowing what task comes next. Whether that’s a planner, a checklist, or an app that takes the thinking out of it, structure is what makes consistency possible.
5. **Your environment beats your willpower.** You don’t skip your habits because you’re weak. You skip them because your setup makes the wrong choice easier. If your phone is right next to you, you’re going to pick it up. If junk food is on the counter, you’re going to eat it. Research from Wendy Wood shows that most of our daily actions are driven by environment and habit, not conscious decision. Willpower is unreliable. Design your space so good choices are the default, not the fight. If your phone is distracting you, put it in another room or use an app blocker. Make the right thing easier and the wrong thing harder.
6. **Reward matters more than you think.** You won’t stick with a habit if it only feels like effort. Your brain needs a reason to come back. That reason is reward. Not in a year, but today. You need a positive feedback loop. Something that tells your brain, “this is working, do it again.” Studies in neuroscience show that dopamine doesn’t just respond to pleasure. It responds to anticipated reward. When the brain expects a payoff, it is more likely to repeat the behaviour. A 1997 paper by Schultz et al. found that dopamine spikes when we predict a reward, not just when we receive one. This is why gamification works. Progress bars, streaks, and small visible wins give your brain a reason to keep going. Make the habit feel rewarding now, and it becomes easier to repeat tomorrow.

I hope this helps. If you’re serious about changing things, this is where it starts.","That's an interesting take on habits and motivation. I've heard some of these points before, but I'd love to understand more about the science behind them. Could you please provide some sources or studies that support these claims? It would be great to have some objective evidence to back up these ideas. Additionally, have you considered the role of external factors such as social support or accountability in habit formation? I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that.",neutral

"Long version: Been married for 18 years, have 3 bio kids together and 1 adult stepson. Marriage has been rocky for a few years now. I realize I've played my part in the state or our marriage (never cheated, and never even so much as raised my voice to her). I've been deployed for 7 months and have 2 left to go. She was not happy at all about me going on deployment. I found out about 3 weeks ago that she has been texting another dude 30+ times a day every single day since March. 

I asked her about this other guy, but I didn't tell her that I know about the volume of texting. The cell phone account is in my name, so I am able to see all of her call and text activity, I just can't see what the contents of the texts are. I was holding off on telling her that I know about the texting, because I feel that I need to see for myself, what they have been texting to each other and I fear that if I tell her, she'll take it to another app and delete all of her texts. Anyway, she said that he was ""just a friend"" that she met at the gym (the memes write themselves) and that there was nothing going on between them, it was just that he was going through a bad divorce, and she was feeling lonely and needed a friend. I'm sure I'll get called dumb, but I don't think there is actually something physical going on. She has taken 2 trips out of town by herself, and it was obvious from the texting that he didn't go with her because they were texting just as much, if not more than when she was home, especially in the evening.

We talked, I'm not sure how productive it was, because it was primarily me confessing to being a shitty husband for my lack of communication that has led us to the point that we're at. And I do take responsibility for my part in this, but I feel like she has taken zero accountability for the things that she's also done to push me away. And when I told her that I wanted to try and repair our relationship when I return and that I was willing to do whatever it took, she was very noncommittal.

This is of course giving me a tremendous amount of anxiety. I've talked with a couple of close friends about this here, so I am getting some support.

So, I'm just not sure if I should even bother trying at this point. If I do find out that she was having a physical affair, or they were sexting each other, it will be a complete deal breaker for me. But if their texting doesn't rise to that level, I'm willing to work things out. I just get the sense from her, that she just doesn't care about me anymore.

As the title says, is this relationship salvageable? And what can I do to bring her around?","I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing in your marriage. It's important to remember that every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to whether it's salvageable or not.

"I'm sure there are tons of posts on here just like the one I'm writing, but I just got my prescription of Vyvanse after 3 months of being off it and I am so grateful for this medication. I am in the process of moving, just left a pretty tumultuous relationship, and have a lot of uncertainty & chaos at this juncture of my life.

"So first off, I never thought I would go to reddit for anything my life; but, here I am. 

**Background description --** I'll keep it simple, it isn't a problem with her, it is an issue with me. 

For prior reference, she is so amazing and has listened to every single word that has made me feel this way and she has been so supportive. She is just so tired all of the time, because right now, she is traveling across the country for a few weeks and just hasn't a lot of free time of her own to think on this, which I understand. (We have been dating for 8.5ish months!) I am also a busy person myself, I run, I keep busy with my activities so I am doing something fulfilling pretty much every second of the day.

**Main Topic --** I just feel like I put myself in a mental cage and I have lost my mental self in our relationship. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing our relationship is and how understanding we are, it's just so hard right now to think through all of this myself. For specific examples, I feel like I am fighting myself everyday and every second on the precise way I text or talk to her. I NEED everything to be perfect all of the time, and it is hurting me. I find myself rereading texts LITERALLY at least 10 times checking to make sure I have covered everything. I want to just to make sure I don't miss anything because the times she isn't busy I treat like gold. I also find myself responding so quickly just at the slightest chance at having a conversation with her if she isn't busy, which we've talked about and hopefully fixed. 

I just put myself in a mental jail to where sometimes I only think about her and I get so angry about everything I do or the little things. I've realized I've wrongfully trained myself for MONTHS to where I don’t wanna feel like I’m doing anything wrong by leaving things out or not doing things either, and I don’t want either of us to resent each other for it. I feel like I’m letting her down if I don’t do all of these things EVERY second and not doing my best for her all of the time (even though she deserves every ounce of love)

TLDR; I've lost myself and my touch mentally.

**Any advice on how to continue and get mentally in tune?** I don't need to go outside more or anything, I am busy most of the day, I just need advice on how to get back to the way I was earlier in our relationship and not the worrying guy I am.

"Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.","I'm interested in the approach you've taken to improve efficiency in language models through Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR).

"Hi everyone,

I’m a rising third-year PhD student at a \~top US university, focusing on causal inference with machine learning. As I navigate the intense “publish or perish” culture, I’m gradually realizing that academia isn’t the right fit for me. Now that I’m exploring industry opportunities, I’ve noticed that most of the well-paid ML roles in tech target vision or language researchers. This is understandable, since causal ML doesn’t seem to be in as much demand.

So far, I have one paper accepted at ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR, and I expect to publish another one or two in those venues over the next few years.

I laid down to take a nap(we have a newborn), and was woken up by my wife saying two women were beating on our door. I was a bit disoriented(you know when you get woken up abruptly), and checked the nest. It was her. I was confused, we met at another location, and she had no info about me. I didn't answer, she told the nest camera she wanted to give the dog back. Then they left.

In the span of about 15 min, they leave messages on both mine and my wife's phones(numbers I didn't give them), and show up my work demanding I take the dog back(I'm on vacation). At this point I'm still confused and a little angry lol. I'm pretty non confrontational and at the same time my brother showed up. Half of me just wanted to call them back and just go get the dog, but the other half of me want nothing to do with people that show up to my job uninvited, much less my home. Before I could think through it, my brother texted and said it he was house sitting and that we were out of town lol, and that it was inappropriate that they showed up to my work. She texted back saying she doesn't want the dog because she's going to lose her apartment if she keeps it.

Is it kind of psycho that they tracked me down, found my job, and then showed up unannounced, or am I being paranoid? I gave them a bunch of dog stuff and dog food. I think one of the boxes had a address label on it and that's how they got it, but I'm not sure.

"For context, my ex and I have only been dated 3 months. I know. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a long time. 

He is 48, lives 1.5 hrs away, has 3 adult children, and widowed since 2020. I'm 34, with a 9 yr old. From since the beginning. I have made it known to him my views on sex. That it's not just intimacy for me, but a commitment. Without the legal part of it. In other words. Marriage. He agreed and has said he has always believed it to be the case also. He pursued me. He has always been the one to come to me for dates, went fishing,  taken us to cedar point as our driver so son and i can enjoy and drove 9 hrs that day. He has slept over 3 times and we never had sex of any form. Farthest we went were kissing. We have gotten so deep in our conversations about our faith, our life struggles, triumphs, fears, visions.. very early on, he has told me how much he loved his wife of 19 yrs. He has said, from the beginning, that he may never fall in love again. That the 2 relationships he had after his wife, he didn't think he loved. Just that he was sweet and kind to them..neither of these 2 met his kids or family. 1 he was with 1 yr, other was 6 months. He said he didn't have feelings for them. But for me, he did. He said I was different. That since he got back out to dating, he has had several first dates because they all were wrong for him. But even if he didn't say out right that he slept with them, I wouldn't be surprised. He has put a lot of efforts with me, given the distance. Spent on me, buying me stuff for my apartment, has helped me a little bit financially also.. courtship...more than just dating. More than that, he made me feel so seen. I have probably general relationship anxiety, or just generally anxiously attached. Of course I fell for him. I've had panic attacks and he had always been there to reassure me he wasn't going anywhere. He knows my history. I know he cared for me. 

I think at the back of mind, I had it all along the doubt planted in there that he may never love me. Therefore the anxiety. Had shown in plenty times, different ways.  In the beginning, he was reassuring, until I started feeling he's getting tired of it. I get it. I was single 4 yrs and celibate, because I knew I have this and its hard to live with this. He never told me he loved did. But has always said he had feelings for me.. I don't even know what that means. Please tell me.


Anyway, he broke up with me a week ago. The latest argument was that whenever he slept over, I noticed he never sat his phone down around me. When we went to cedar point, i can guess he had it on DND because when i called it to let him know where we we are at, it was off. He used it for gps in car and there was an announcement by siri that phone notification has been set for alerts for directions only. I just kept quiet.And even when he went to bed, it was in his pocket. I wasn't accusing i don't think, but I told him I was bothered by it. How it feels secretive. It took a while before I brought that up, he didn't like it. My fault also, I should have very early on. And maybe it was wrong timing because he has also been having financial crisis because of debt left by his Late wife.. Anyway, he broke up with me saying he cannot do al these emotionally right now because of everything going on with his life. That he hoped to be able to dive in and start feeling like he can love again, but hasn't gotten there and we are having all these issues already. That he cares so much about me and wouldn't want to hold me back from my happiness.. all I replied was ""I accept your decision"".. he then proceeded to text more asking if we could remain as friends because he wanted to keep me in his life. And I said, ""not right now""..then texted again that night we broke up, to assure me, he wasn't communicating with anyone else.  And I didn't reply.

Few days later, I texted him to let him know I was sorry for all my share in the demise of the relationship and that I cared about him. That he treated me with kindness, patience and trust..he did..and that when I can be totally at peace with the idea of never becoming more, I wanted to keep him in my life as my friend. We've never seen each other naked. So I figured, this man was good to me and it should be okay.

He texted back to let me know he wanted the same thing, that I was truly important to him and that I made him want to become a better Christian. That he wants to keep me in his life as a friend or eventually more.. and that he realized he needed healing.. and get back to his faith, so he can be free to love again.. and that when that happens...he will come find me..he wants us to remain close and keep in touch.. but part of me is scared.

"
I (23f) really never thought I would ever make a mistake like this. I have been cheated on before and I know how bad it hurts. Im still wondering about whether or not I was also taken advantage of by my ex bf (22m). 

Me and my ex bf broke up and we had been on and off with no contact for about 6 months. Around a month or 2 ago my ex reaches out one morning and we decided to meet up just to talk. He told me I was under appreciated and taken for granted and he wanted to close out our contact by talking about it. 

Earlier in the day (on the phone) I laid out the boundary of “no weird shit” because at the time I had a bf (23m). He knew this.
Me and my ex got to talking about the past, good memories and bad and somewhere along the line he leans in to kiss me. To which I lean away. In the moment I was caught up on whether or not I actually wanted to kiss him. He kept leaning in at various moments and I would lean/turn away. At one point I even lightly pushed his face away. 

He kept complimenting me saying “You look so beautiful right now, come on kiss me” and “You know you want to” and it really got in my head.

At this point I still couldn’t tell if I wanted to kiss him. I felt like he was playing with me so I tried to hit back by saying “If you had any balls, you would just do it” and he did it. 

For a second, it felt like I could’ve had him back but he didn’t stick around. After a few days I realized he just wanted to use me as a rebound. He broke up with his then gf a little bit before he reached out. I felt horrible for even being there that day. The fact that I even met up with my ex without telling my bf was cause enough for me to understand that I wasn’t ready for/deserving of a relationship. That night I told my then boyfriend everything that happened and he split. I didn’t blame him one bit. 

Anyway, it doesn’t feel good. My then bf was very patient in the ways I struggled. He supported me in so many ways in such a short amount of time. Being with him felt like an adventure where I didn’t have to think about the ways my ex bf hurt me or how I hurt him. I don’t know how to continue in the actions of processing all this and recovering. 

I hate the idea of being on a “healing journey” because I feel like I have been “healing” for two years straight at a snails pace.  I like to often believe that pain exists to make room for happiness but I’m not too confident I deserve to heal and be happy.

Bad day? puff. Not a good day at office - puff lunch break - smoking. argument with someone- Smoke. Being bored at 2AM overthinking life? Yet again Smoke
Lighting up a cigg literally became like a muscle memory, like the second I felt anything uncomfortable, I was outside with a cigarette before I even realized what I was doing.

"A patient in a place I trained before finishing my education requested to meet my dog while I was still there. I wasn't able to at the time but promised I'd bring her at SOME point. Some point was last week - but after I found out the looooong trail of paperwork I'd have to deal with (the process is meant for regular visits and includes submitting photos of the dog and a physical ID card for the animal, not suitable for a one time visit at ALL) I decided to just do a low stakes reverse heist and sneak in with her today. 

To be clear, it's an organisational issue, not at ALL hygiene etc, in case that's a concern, dogs ARE allowed and I'm well familiar with the rules. The only consequences would have been a scolding and being asked to leave, maybe not even that - nothing serious. 

On my way to the patient I wanted to see I spotted another one I knew liked dogs, so I stopped by his room and let him pet her also, asked him not to rat me out. Located the patient I specifically wanted to see - she pet my dog, I asked her not to snitch. On the way out, I met two more I knew and let them pet the dog also, told them not to tell anyone. 

I was spotted at this point by a super nice former colleague, who, instead of ratting me out, joined the heist and suggested some of his patients who liked dogs also, so we continued on his floor. Each of the patients promised not to tell and pet/fed my dog. 

I spent about 3-4 hours sneaking a 5kg dog in a backpack through a medical facility so some 15+ patients could pet a dog (for many of them, the first in many years). It was incredibly fun for me and felt like a child sneaking around, and a loooot of people got to fulfil their wish of petting a dog again! I was offered a red bull and some ice cream as a 'bribe' for being allowed to give my dog her treats etc. Everyone was super invested in my 'crime'.

"I'm sure there are tons of posts on here just like the one I'm writing, but I just got my prescription of Vyvanse after 3 months of being off it and I am so grateful for this medication. I am in the process of moving, just left a pretty tumultuous relationship, and have a lot of uncertainty & chaos at this juncture of my life. I've been depressed and drowning in shame for the past two months. 

I took it today and I was able to get myself organized and have some difficult conversations. It's really quite nice to be able to have this calm and centeredness underlying my day. I can actually stand up to life again.

There's so much internalized ableism I'm still unlearning that keeps me trapped in shame and guilt for how my brain operates and shames me for my reliance on medication. It is bullshit.

But I also believe very strongly the middle road is usually the best path, and an ideal life of having ADHD means balancing medication with alternative methods and taking it in rhythms and seasons. I don't know what this ideal state looks like for me, but I'm curious how others have practiced finding a balance--or what managing ADHD looks like for people similar to me.

","I'm glad to hear that the Vyvanse prescription is helping you manage your daily life and tackle the challenges you're facing right now. It's important to remember that everyone's experience with ADHD and medication is unique, and what works best can vary greatly from person to person.

Have you considered exploring alternative methods, such as therapy or lifestyle changes, to supplement your medication routine? There's a wealth of information and resources available on /r/ADHD and other platforms that might provide some inspiration or guidance. Additionally, it could be helpful to connect with others in the community to learn about their experiences and strategies for managing ADHD.

"After 3 yrs of dating and trying to find a partner, I finally met someone who's got most of the internal qualities anyone would want in partner. Kind, empathetic, mature, emotionally aware and the biggest one - calms my nervous system. 

However, he lives in another city, with no solid plan to move near me (my city has more job opportunities and he's been trying to change his job but the economy is horrible). I wasn’t initially considering him as a serious match due to the distance. Ended up meeting him 3 times when he was here, and found it hard to be attracted to him, if I'm being really specific, it was his body type (I hate pointing this one out). I was taken aback since his photos on the profile were old where he was much fit and younger? Every conversation I have over video calls makes me drawn to his personality but I vowed to myself that I will not entertain long distance due to my past ldr relationships. 

Now that I truly like being single, I value quality relationships. Even if I wait and let the attraction grow, I don't foresee it being possible over video calls. Appreciate any thoughts

TLDR: everything seems good emotionally with this guy but not sure if I should continue if the relationship will require us being long distance. 


Edit: Thank you all! Extremely grateful to get a response.","Have you considered exploring the possibility of open communication and regular video calls as a way to maintain the emotional connection despite the distance? I understand that physical attraction can be important in a romantic relationship, but it's not the only factor. Some couples make long distance relationships work through consistent communication and emotional intimacy. It might be worth giving it a try and seeing how it goes. Additionally, have you discussed with him the potential of him moving or finding a job in your city, or maybe even a compromise where you meet halfway occasionally?

"I’ve posted like a hundred times, but my mom (59) had fallen on June 9th and has tibial plateau surgery the next day. she also fractured her ankle. she’s been bedridden mostly ever since since it’s a non weight bearing break. In the last week she’s definitely been more awake and alert, but her muscles are definitely deconditioning. She’s likely mild-moderate and still has some nueroplasticity in her, she can learn through repetition, but she hasn’t been sleeping well through the night which is making it harder for her to follow through on exercises and such. It’s so hard. We’re trying our best to get her to be able to walk again at some point and she wants to so bad, and it’s hard to see her not want to or be unable to participate. And I can’t even figure out what the problem is. Can she not tell which leg she can use? Is she scared to hurt herself? Is the movement painful? Is she too tired to understand? I’m not sure. But it’s hard. I want her to walk again so bad and she does too, and it’s hard to see her like this. Her 6 week xray is on Wednesday and we’re told the ankle cast will likely come off, and if her knee is healing well we may get cleared for partial weight bearing or a hinge brace to start some movement, and I m scared. I don’t know if it will help. I don’t know if she’ll walk again. I for so long felt in my bones she would, and I still feel like that, but right now I feel defeated. I feel like she isn’t or can’t try hard enough to help us get her there. And she’s incredibly upset at being bedbound. She hates the depends. She wants to use a bathroom. She wants to go to bed upstairs and take a shower. She wants to go to the grocery store with my dad. And I want all these for her. And I don’t know how to get her there anymore.

"Hey everyone — I’ve been dealing with a lot of ADHD-related burnout lately, and sound has been one of the few things that helps me stay grounded during long stretches of executive dysfunction, overthinking, or just… nothingness.

I put together a 10-hour cinematic rain loop with soft ambient textures, subtle affirmations, and lo-fi GTA-style visuals. No lyrics. Just something to run in the background while cleaning, working, resting, or quietly buffering.

"Happy to announce an exciting new project from the lab: “Adopting a human developmental visual diet yields robust, shape-based AI vision”. An exciting case where brain inspiration profoundly changed and improved deep neural network representations for computer vision.

Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168)

The idea: instead of high-fidelity training from the get-go (the de facto gold standard), we simulate the visual development from newborns to 25 years of age by synthesising decades of developmental vision research into an AI preprocessing pipeline (Developmental Visual Diet - DVD).

We then test the resulting DNNs across a range of conditions, each selected because they are challenging to AI:

1. shape-texture bias
2. recognising abstract shapes embedded in complex backgrounds
3. robustness to image perturbations
4. adversarial robustness.

We report a new SOTA on shape-bias (reaching human level), outperform AI foundation models in terms of abstract shape recognition, show better alignment with human behaviour upon image degradations, and improved robustness to adversarial noise - all with this one preprocessing trick.

This is observed across all conditions tested, and generalises across training datasets and multiple model architectures.

We are excited about this, because DVD may offers a resource-efficient path toward safer, perhaps more human-aligned AI vision. This work suggests that biology, neuroscience, and psychology have much to offer in guiding the next generation of artificial intelligence.

2. How does the DVD pipeline compare to other preprocessing methods in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements?

"Hi Reddit, its been almost two months since my last update and I wanted to give one final update to everyone who has helped me deal with this situation. I've received a ton of good advice and well wishes and I can't thank everyone enough for the support I received in what was the loneliest time of my life.

My last update ended with my wife quitting her job, her starting individual therapy and us still being sleeping in separate rooms. 

Since then we have started couples therapy, our therapist specifically deals with emotional and physical infidelity, and go three times a week. While I know that may seem excessive to some people, we really needed. Some weeks we don't need the third session and our therapist suggested we cancel and instead go on a date, something simple where we could just get used to being around eachother again. I also started individual therapy at our couples therapist's suggestion to help me with my anger and drinking. I'm not an alcoholic but I was starting to develop a drinking problem and using it to numb myself to any pain. It's alot of fucking work but its helping. My wife and I also spoke with my eldest daughter's school as she picked up the tension in our house and it was causing behavioural issues at school and at home and they are offering support to her as well. It feels like we've had to break our family down to rebuild it again, I'm just glad my youngest is oblivious to anything going on.

After leaving her job my wife asked me if I would be okay if she didn't work for a couple months as she wanted to focus on fixing our marriage and family before she committed to something else. I get paid more than enough to cover our expenses so I agreed to it. I've never really had an opinion on her working, I would've supported her regardless of if she worked or not but seeing the way my daughters have loved having their mother home with them more and how attentive of a mother my wife is cracked me open. I just couldn't numb myself to her anymore. Instead of listening to them having fun or my daughter's laughing while being holed up in my office, I wanted to be with them. I had so much anger and pride in me that I was choosing to sulk alone and drink rather than spending time with my family that I wanted back so badly. The first time I joined them it was awkward and weird but my therapist told me I needed to sit in that discomfort and face it rather than hiding away.

My brothers and parents have been a great support during this time as well, my dad and older brothers were quicker to forgive Annie than my mom was. She adored Annie and was disappointed by what she had done but Annie has said she's going to work hard to earn everybody's trust again. Annie's mother still isn't talking to her however she still sees her granddaughters, she comes over only when Annie isn't home or I drop my daughter's off at her house sometimes so they can spend the day with her. We've gotten closer and it's weird getting invited to events from Annie's side of the family when she isn't included but I have to go for my daughters.

After multiple sessions with our couples therapist where I openly discussed how much grief her betrayal had caused me, Annie decided to tell her coworkers wife about the affair. She said she wanted to give Mark/Matt the opportunity to tell his wife himself and contacted him to say she would be letting his wife know and he should tell her before it came from somebody else. She heard from her old coworkers she was still friendly with that Mark/Matt had told his wife. Annie thought Mark/Matt's wife would've contacted her to corroborate any stories but last we heard they were separating since Annie's sister realised Mark/Matt's wife had changed her relationship status on Facebook. 

As for Annie and I, we've had to have alot of brutally honest conversations. Of course she was  not right for what she did but I also had to own upto my mistakes as well. There was so much resentment in her towards me that even she didn’t realise at first, specifically around the birth of our eldest daughter. She had felt isolated and abandoned during that pregnancy and post-partum because I was working too much and studying at the same time. She was the primary parent for the first year of our daughter's life, I thought I was doing the right thing back then and had kind of disregarded her when she said she felt overwhelmed or lonely because I felt the same way, the difference was she had a whole baby to take care of as well. She said she felt the same way after our little one was born but could handle it better since she had been through it before and didn't expect anything from me. I had to travel quite a bit for my job back then and looking back I had never really asked her if she was okay with that. It was humbling sitting there and listening to her recount the ways she had struggled while taking care of our daughters and never threw it my face. I realised that I needed her forgiveness as much as she needed mine. It's going to take time for us to rebuild this 'new relationship' but we both know the work is worth it. We're going on dates again and actually talking to eachother about something other than the kids. We're still sleeping in separate bedrooms, when it comes to physical intimacy I learnt I had a lot of issues with it when it came to my self esteem. After imagining my wife with another man I needed her to show me how much she desired me for me to feel comfortable with her again and she's been going above and beyond with that.


Apart from that I can't think of anything else to give an update on. Feel free to ask any questions I'm already a open book but the biggest lesson I've learnt from this whole situation is that complacency and miscommunication are the death of relationships. Never let your significant other feel like they aren't a priority or their needs are falling on deaf ears. It's too easy to blame one person for the demise of a relationship and in some cases that might be true but if you know a person and they do something completely out of character try to examine why. You don't have to forgive them or anything like that, sometimes it is best to walk away. Again, that's for all the support. Also, I didn't reread this so apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes.  ","I'm glad to hear that you and your wife have been making progress in your therapy sessions and have started to rebuild your relationship. It takes a lot of courage to face the challenges that come with infidelity and I commend you both for your commitment to working through it. I'm also glad to hear that your daughters have been enjoying having their mother at home more. Could you elaborate on the specific ways that your wife's presence has positively impacted them? I'm curious to understand how this dynamic has changed for your family. Additionally, you mentioned that your wife had felt isolated and abandoned during your eldest daughter's pregnancy and post-partum. Have you two discussed how you can ensure that she feels",neutral
"This happened two weeks ago but me and my boyfriend have been bickering about it since and he's been cold with me so I decided to post about it. Throwaway because he has my Reddit account, but he doesn't view this sub. Also sorry for any issues, English isn't my first language

My (22F) parents raised me teaching me domestic skills at a young age, mainly cooking and baking. This wasn't because I was a girl, but it was because my mum thought it was a life skill and she came from a family where both men and women did a lot of cooking. My boyfriend (23M) was raised in a ""fast food house"" and never learned how to cook proper meals because he grew up on takeaway and microwave meals.

We've been together for a year and I count on my hand the amount of times he's actually attempted and made a half-way decent meal. I'm not some 5-star chef, but this grown man doesn't know how to make instant mashed potatoes, cook chicken, make pasta or bake a box of cake mix. He's even terrible when it comes to making foods where the cooking/baking/prep instructions are literally on the back or sides of the packaging.

I've asked him several times to try and learn. Watch a TV show, take a class, read a book about it, hell, even a YouTube or Tiktok video but he refuses to learn how to properly cook anything that's not a basic sandwich (he can't even toast his bread correctly even though I've shown him how to do it in a pan, in the oven and in a toaster)

The other day he tried to make a package of those flavored rice dishes and chicken and he overboiled the water all over our stove (we have a gas stove as well so we had to open all the windows since the flame went out) and managed to char the outside of the chicken and still leaving the inside raw (I still don't know how this was managed). I ended up stepping in and cooking our dinner for us after cleaning the rice water off the stove and scraping char bits off my pan.

He didn't help me cook this second time and when he came to eat I just got a little irritated and said that he needs to learn how to cook at least a few basic meals because I'm tired of always having to cook for him and sometimes clean up after his kitchen disasters.

He said he doesn't understand the big deal about it because I want kids, so that means that I'll be cooking and cleaning up messes constantly anyways. I argued back that it's completely different having to constantly cook for and clean up after a baby or child because they literally can't do it for themselves compared to a grown man who just refuses to learn. I also said that when I have kids I'm teaching all of them life skills like cooking so they won't be helpless and relying on their partner to take care of them like a child when they grow up.

He said I was overreacting and that I won't make a good wife or mother if I complain this much about cooking for people and cleaning up messes. He also called me a hypocrite because admittedly I'm not the most tidy person (he pointed out that my desk and bookshelf is a cluttered mess right now).

I do feel bad for arguing with him over this but I'm tired of having to constantly take care of him like he's a child. He's a grown man who should be able to do this for himself. I also hate how he's making me dislike cooking, because I actually love cooking and cooking for others, but he's just draining the fun out of it and I'm actually considering breaking up with him unless he actually starts showing an effort to learn how to cook, or to at least stop making such a mess with every failed attempt. I need some advice. Anyone else been in my shoes before?","I'm sorry to hear about the ongoing issue you're having with your boyfriend and the cooking situation. It seems like a source of frustration for both of you. While I don't have personal experience with this exact situation, I can understand the importance of cooking skills in a relationship and the potential challenges that come with teaching someone new.

Have you considered seeking out cooking classes or workshops in your area that you could attend together? It might be an opportunity for both of you to learn and grow in the kitchen while spending quality time together. Additionally, there are numerous free resources online like YouTube videos, blogs, and websites dedicated to teaching cooking skills. Perhaps, you could recommend some of these resources to your boyfriend and offer to help him",neutral
"Location: Illinois


My dad married his ex-wife when I was 17. She was a stereotypical people-user and she told my mom, in front of me, that she taught her daughters you marry for money not love. Dear dad didn't get the memo. He said he made her sign a pre-nup so he thought he was golden and she was so perfect and blah blah blah. She turned him against my sisters and I to the point we really didn't have a relationship for ~13 years, until she filed for divorce and got around the prenup. He said there's a law that let's your spouse work around the prenuptial after 14 years. I don't know. She took everything from him including the inheritance my grandmother left entirely to him with a verbal instruction to divide amongst me and my sisters/his half siblings. Spoilers alert, he kept everything and then shared it with his wife and left my sisters and I to struggle and figure things out on our own. Which we did, but it wasn't easy. 


When they divorced my father also had gotten an Alzheimers diagnosis. When we started trying to help take care of him (begrudgingly on my part, willingly on my sister's) he swore he had taken care of fixing the will. He wasn't too far gone in the diagnosis yet, so we thought he did. Hindsight is 20-20.


My dad passed away a few months ago. My sister has been in charge of his estate and she found out the hard way that my dad never updated his will. The will that he had filled out most recently was thankfully voided because it left 1/3 of the estate to me and everything else to his ex wife. The new one has 1/3 to me, 1/3 to one sister and 1/3 to a 3rd party that won't be revealed to us but no one else in our family has come forth with it, including 2 half sisters who called Just to see if they were the 3rd beneficiary. They were not. Which leads us to ex wife. 


The inheritance is small for us, around $8000 a piece. His pension however is not being given to either of us. I don't know anything about estate law. My father worked for the state and I've been told his pension is like ~$100k. Is there any standing we would have to contest this? I don't even necessarily want the money though of course it would help. But that woman has stolen so much from our family, including the relationship with our dad. She doesn't deserve this.


Thank you.","I'm sorry to hear about the complicated situation with your father's estate. It's important to clarify a few things regarding the pension distribution. I'm not an expert in estate law or pension benefits, but I can suggest looking into the specifics of your father's employment contract and pension plan. Some pensions may provide survivor benefits for children or other dependents, especially in cases where there are no surviving spouses or minor children. It might be worth consulting with a lawyer or reaching out to the pension administrator for more information. Additionally, it could be helpful to review the divorce settlement agreement to determine if there were any provisions related to pension distribution.

"I am 21F in NYC and in the last 2-3 month I started using cocaine first 1 in a blue moon and then 1-2 x a week now . I am a college student and have an internship this summer/have been fully functional but I am truly terriified about th*e WAY* I think about cocaine.

I worry about addiction but simultaneously compulsively think about it all week and when I go out even on a Tuesday to have a drink with girlfriends, I get so excited in the hours before to go out and snort coke seccretly in the bathroom without telling anyone.

I really want to stop. I am currently writing this in a come down at 5am on a Wed morning and I am seriously struggling. I have just told 2 friends I trust in excruciating detail about how scared I feel to become an addict... I am going to HATE that in the morning... I hate the comedown so so much it makes me regret everything and I feel so truly ashamed the next day until 2-3 days later I am craving it at my summer internship again.

I AM OTHERWISE SUCH A QUAINT UNSUSPECTING GIRL! I just somehow convince myself everybody does it and no one feels guilt about it and no one lets it get out of control / everyone else in Finance does it and is functioning perfectly...

I think I have a multitude of underlying depression/anxiety/ADHD problems that have caused me to become so ""obsessive"" so quickly. This has convinced me that I have deep issues. I hate the person I have become with this. I do not want to be perceived as a ""coke whore"" I want to be NOT that girl so so bad... so I have hid it to every extent possible but I feel so much shame the following day for acting so crazy the night before. I fear some people suspect it anyway.

Just tonight I went out with a group of girlfriends for a casual Tuesday drink and was secretly snorting coke in the bathroom. I LOVED IT :(

I also have a fresh Rhinoplasty 6 months out. I am such a moron??

I just threw my bag out of the window. I hate NYC so much sometimes because it is ALL around me.

I don't know if this qualifies for enough for addiction yet but I know the *WAY* i think about it and worry about it means I am certainly susceptible for this becoming out of control if I do not stop.

I am not the kind of person that can casually do anything I have realized.

PLEASE: PLEASE only leave encouraging comments that will affirm that I should not be doing cocaine and that it is not good for me and that I am able to stop (despite horror stories of years of addiction which almsot confirm that I will never be able to stop?). I haven't been a disciplined person and am super soft genuinely so I could never quit if I was so so addicted I fear. Cocaine may not be a big deal to some people but it is to me and this has become clear tonight for that reason. Please give me tips on how to stop this... I plan to tell my therapist about this but I am so afraid of talking about this to anyone at all. He is also kind of a bad therapist idk.

"I went out on just a couple dates with someone. He ghosted me when I wasn’t able to meet as often as he’d like (we were meeting weekly) as I had let him know i had just gotten out of something and I needed time to process everything (EDIT: I said this because i was being asked to commit to being exclusive the next week). He came back and apologized a month later saying he could sense my “disinterest” (meanwhile i had made clear my interest - despite hesitation of doing so so early- multiple time during the dates) and I said its ok but I was surprised he felt that way because I was beyond transparent even though it felt hard to be so transparent so early in dating (early dating should be light and fun). I tried to ask how he was doing but he ghosted again. Perhaps because he again thought i was not interested.

So i gave it sometime and did something I wish someone had done for me when i had been insecure in the past and jumped the gun of someones “interest” - i sent him a text letting him know it was too much too soon when he questioned my interest during those dates. That id be open to reconnecting but only if our paces align- because our paces feel mismatched.  He replied that he would be open too and he acknowledged his issues on making it heavy early on. When i assured him ive done the same in the past and then i tried to keep it light again by asking about his going ons… silence which i dont mind - i dont care if someone ghosts like that. But if it was done -again- because the person would rather have heavy talks or thinks we should be meeting in person to continue this talk— it feels too much again.  After two dates, no one should hve to be walking on eggshells. And it feels like I am here constantly. As a female, im not used to this. But now that i am on the other side i empathize with the male species who had to deal with me being like this. Admittedly ive never done this after just a few dates. But eh.

"Edit 2: Reading the responses, I feel like I'm forced to choose between love and being financially responsible.

----------

Edit: Woke up to a bunch of comments and I responded to a lot of them. How are people dating with just a couple hundred left over each month? Especially when the man is expected to pay for the majority of dates?

Also with the women I've entered into a relationship with, the majority were expecting me to own my home, not rent.

-------------

For the women of Reddit, how important is it for the man you're dating to have his own home? I've been told by my friends and family members that one of the reasons I'm not making much dating progress is because I'm a 33 year old, East Asian (Canadian Born Chinese) male who currently lives at home with his mom. It seems that for the majority of the women I date, whether first dates or in a relationship with, the moment they hear this, they instantly lose interest. Or in the case of one of my past relationships, she said I needed to move out within 3 months of going official or she'd break up with me.

It's not that I don't want to move out. Nor am I your stereotypical guy living at home in his mom's basement. I contribute around the house and pay rent. But financially speaking, it's near impossible for me to move out. I take home over $4k/month and I still don't have sufficient down payment to buy a condo unless I borrow over $100k from my mom because I can get only about a $300k mortgage loan @ \~4%. For reference, a good 1+1 bedroom condo with parking costs about $530k in my city. After paying all expenses and the mortgage, I'd have about $500 left each month. If I rented, the amount left increases slightly to about $1,000 each month. With either option, I'd become financially stressed and would have a very difficult time saving. I'm not a fan of living with roommates either, especially since I'd be confined to my room when I have the house to myself right now. I'm fairly independent and short of taking women home for a night of fun, I can pretty much do whatever I want.
","I can understand the financial pressures you're facing when it comes to buying a home and balancing dating expenses. It's a common challenge for many people, especially in expensive cities like yours. Have you considered looking into alternative living arrangements, such as shared ownership or co-living spaces? These options could potentially help reduce the financial burden of home ownership while still allowing you to have your own space. It might be worth exploring these possibilities, as they could make both your dating life and financial situation more manageable. Good luck with your dating journey!",neutral
"What level of care does someone who has really variable good days and bad days? 

Good days are where they are coherent in conversation, sometimes self-aware about their confusion and can remember some past events, but may still have short-term memory loops and not be able to cognitively process any technology or schedules or even know the day or time. Bad days are where they are very confused incredibly repetitive, fixated and frustrated, make bad decisions to disregard social norms, and do erratic things like spend all their money on things they don’t need (10 pairs of pants) and “feel dizzy.”

She had a couple falls the week before she went in and now doesn’t feel safe and can’t probably go back to her independent living building, but she is not on any list for subsidized care as her disease progression has had a steep decline in the last month… We guess the hospital wants her out (she’s been there almost two weeks, nothing seems medically wrong). So they won’t want to let her stay much longer, but they can’t safely discharge to her current level of care. They asked me about our ability to pay for private long term care but pricing it out is outrageous / month 🤑! Assisted care seems like too much freedom not enough support for her to be safe (falls and wandering)… she obviously will need long term care at some point but is now too soon? Should we refuse to discharge her until they find us a subsidized long term bed? Or is keeping her in the hospital too cruel to her dignity and last coherent days with some intermittent capacity ? I’m her primary care giver with a family and a teenager of my own. My dad died in at Xmas and he did everything for them which hid how bad things were.

Let’s say things ended with someone- doesn’t even matter who ended it. And in that breakup discussion you were nicer to them than they deserved. Instead of telling them the ways they hurt you, you made it sound mutual and kind and blameless. But later, you thought about all the hurtful things they did that you let slide for whatever reason (avoiding conflict probably?) that you never brought up and they may not even realize they did.

Did going back after a breakup and telling someone how they did something wrong that hurt you make you feel better? Did it make you feel worse? Or, do you regret not having done it?

"I had a teratoma tumor (Stage 1B) with a neoplasia in situ (stage 0) and had surgery 5 weeks ago and feel great honestly, pre-surgery I thought I was dying and after surgery I have improved in every way so when I got the final diagnosis it felt like, okay this is finally done with and can move on, but then they did blood tests and the numbers are way off and now, suddenly they are raising serious concerns and now ports, PET scan and 3 month of aggressive chemo by the tumor board is pushing for immediate action even though, I'd like to see more blood tests given the time frame.

The tumor also produced large amounts of estrogen which caused significant body changes contributing to pain as well.

* **Left testis, radical orchiectomy:**
* **Organ-confined post-pubertal type teratoma:** The tumor is a teratoma (a type of germ cell tumor) that is confined within the testis and has not spread beyond it. ""Post-pubertal type"" refers to a form of teratoma that occurs after puberty, which behaves differently from pre-pubertal teratomas.
* **Spermatic cord margin negative for tumor:**
* **Pathologic stage pT1b pNX (AJCC 8th edition):**
   * **pT1b:** The tumor is limited to the testis but has certain features such as size or involvement that place it in this specific category.
   * **pNX:** Lymph nodes were not assessed or cannot be assessed (meaning they don't have conclusive data on lymph node involvement from this specimen).
* **No yolk sac tumor identified despite elevated AFP:** Although your blood tests showed elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker often elevated in yolk sac tumors, none was found in the tissue examined. They checked carefully using special stains (immunohistochemistry) and didn't find clear evidence of yolk sac tumor cells.
* **Small focus of germ cell neoplasia in situ:** This means there are some abnormal germ cells present in the testis that could be the source of elevated beta-hCG levels (another tumor marker).
* **Overall: Post-pubertal type teratoma with no clear evidence of other germ cell tumor components.**

It was removed with no evidence of more aggressive tumors, with clear margins and no invasive spread detected.   CT Scan with contrast only detected the 3cm teratoma, everything else looked clear.  X-Ray of the same area revealed bone structure also clear,   CT Scan without contrast of chest also showed clear results.

Pure mature teratoma (no yolk sac, no embryonal carcinoma, no choriocarcinoma).

* Confined to testis with clear margins.
* No lymphovascular invasion reported.

Blood Test Results - Surgery to remove the tumor occurred on June 16th

Estrogen, Blood, Serum  
June 5th 390  
July 8th 340

LD  
June 5th 1087  
July 8th 1300

This is a concern, but I had surgery and a hematoma formed, which could be a reason for this?

Beta-HCG, Quantitative  
June 5th 2050  
July 8th  1750

AFP

June 5th 321.4  
July 8th 560

This is the concerning part, also the surgery was on June 16th which could further increased the AFP in the time frame,  this is likely the cause of the concern and subsequent Chemo request?

No actual checks of the lymph nodes were done because the tumor was supposedly removed with clear margins,  The surgeon also detected a hematoma in the removed testis part which could also raise certain levels.

**Bottom line, here - is there a benign reasoning for this, should I request another blood marker panel first before just jumping straight into 3 months of destructive chemo,   I can still feel firmness on the surgery site given its still healing, and can feel the small lump of the hemotoma where the surgeon located it on my two-week post op appointment.**

**I know, microscopic spread was not confirmed, the surgeon started that tumor burn-out was his professional opinion,   I have an appointment with the oncologist on Wednesday and I feel like I should directly request a retest of the Beta HCG, LD and AFP at least,  if the AFP and LD are continuing to rise, that could mean - either microscopic spread or possible hidden tumor somewhere outside of the area's that were tested?**

Reasonable assumptions, could it also mean something sneaked by and infected some lymph nodes that are swollen,   that swelling also does not automatically mean cancer, they could be reactive to the pain, surgery too.

**On top of all this, my house is problematic for chemo therapy in general, we have cats, a dog and a cockatiel,  plus we have limited space, mildew issues and other potential issues.** ","I'm glad to hear that your surgery went well and you're feeling better. I can understand your concerns regarding the recent blood test results and the suggestion of chemotherapy. It's important to remember that these test results are just one piece of the puzzle, and there are several factors that could contribute to the changes you're seeing.

Have you discussed the potential impact of the hematoma on your blood tests with your doctor? A hematoma can cause an increase in certain markers, and it's possible that this could be contributing to the elevated levels you're seeing. It might be worth requesting additional tests to rule out other potential causes before making any decisions about chemotherapy.

"Last night I posted about how to go about if (and how) I should explain to my father's wife (who is my age) that I need to be paid to care for him while she's at work all day. It would be 5 days a week for 7 hours per day (plus a 2 hour drive).  
  
In my post I explained past boundary issues (me struggling to draw them and them taking advantage of that) and how I wanted to try to be helpful but fair. You all were so kind, helpful and encouraging. 

The nurse came today to fill us in on the plan for in-home OT, PT, Nurse, etc -  and it will all be covered by Medicare - except of course a daily home aid (what I'm doing). I asked the nurse what that would cost and he said it's $45 per hour.

His wife had previously offered to pay me $100 per week for two days, so that's essentially $50 per day. But then it turned out they'll need me 5 days a week. Some of you suggested no less than $50/day. Many of you suggested much more for the entire week. I was actually considering staying at $100, maybe $150 per week. But today I decided if she was okay with $50 per day for two days, she should be okay with $50 per day in general, right?

So that's what I asked for, $50 per day which would be $250 per week. I had previously told her I cannot do weekends, as I'll need to rest and recover, and also because she runs around shopping for clothes and does lunch with friends all weekend, so it's hardly a necessity. 

I DO realize the amount is very low, but it even asking for that much was incredibly difficult for me and that amount will help me make ends meet and will be beneficial.

She looked like she was going to pass out, and then said ""That's $250 a week"". I said ""Yes, but here's the brochure for the home-aid place, they would charge you $1,575.00 per week. You would pay them for one hour what you'd pay me for the whole day.

So her next two comments are still puzzling me, but I'm overtired so maybe I'm missing something. First she said ""But I would be paying you myself, not from your father's account"". They keep separate bank accounts but she is listed on his accounts as a joint holder, so I really don't know what the issue is or what she was implying. She has access to both their accounts but he doesn't have access to hers, by their own weird mutual agreement. I honestly still don't know what her point was or what that has to do with me but she seemed to be implying something.  
  
I just said ""I guess you'll have to work that out with him, I'm not sure how you guys want to handle it"". She seemed to be saying she should pay less because SHE is paying me as opposed to HIM? But he's her husband, not mine, so the comment was confusing. Thoughts?

The second thing she said confused me even more, which was ""But can you work Saturdays?"" I said ""No, remember, I can't work the weekends, I will need to rest"". And she said ""But who will watch your father? I want to work overtime so I can pay you."" I said ""But you'd have to pay me for coming on a Saturday, so what would be the point?"" and she was quiet. I think she wanted me to work Saturdays for free so she could do overtime??? I'm honestly not sure. Like I said in my post last night, she will absolutely push me and take what she can. I sensed some sort of manipulation attempt but just shut down any idea of weekends.

I drove home thinking about how little $50 per day is for what the time investment and the level of care I'd be giving and felt less and less guilty. That works out to $7.14/hr which is less than minimum wage in my state and that's before the gas I'd have to use for the 2 hour drive each day. She's getting a bargain for bleep's sake.

She has a huge family who all help each other out and I am my father's only family. I guess if she doesn't like it, she can get one of her many family members to come do it for cheaper - but I highly doubt anyone would.

I would not have asked for even that small amount if it weren't for the supportive and encouraging comments last night in this sub. I have no family or support so it meant the world to me. Thank you.","It's understandable that you're trying to find a fair arrangement for providing care for your father while ensuring your own financial needs are met.

"Happy to announce an exciting new project from the lab: “Adopting a human developmental visual diet yields robust, shape-based AI vision”. An exciting case where brain inspiration profoundly changed and improved deep neural network representations for computer vision.

Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168)

The idea: instead of high-fidelity training from the get-go (the de facto gold standard), we simulate the visual development from newborns to 25 years of age by synthesising decades of developmental vision research into an AI preprocessing pipeline (Developmental Visual Diet - DVD).

We then test the resulting DNNs across a range of conditions, each selected because they are challenging to AI:

1. shape-texture bias
2. recognising abstract shapes embedded in complex backgrounds
3. robustness to image perturbations
4. adversarial robustness.

We report a new SOTA on shape-bias (reaching human level), outperform AI foundation models in terms of abstract shape recognition, show better alignment with human behaviour upon image degradations, and improved robustness to adversarial noise - all with this one preprocessing trick.

This is observed across all conditions tested, and generalises across training datasets and multiple model architectures.

We are excited about this, because DVD may offers a resource-efficient path toward safer, perhaps more human-aligned AI vision. This work suggests that biology, neuroscience, and psychology have much to offer in guiding the next generation of artificial intelligence.

I thought about changing to a gamma VAE and implement a new loss function instead of the MSE. Another option is to use the yeo Johnson normalization and keep the MSE. Or I could try to combine the normalization with the gamma loss function? Do you have advices or any different ideas?

"That should say HBOT hell ffs autocorrect 

I started a course of HBOT (hyperbaric oxygen therapy) at an MS centre a while ago. I think it was helping, I still felt rubbish but my capacity increases and stayed stable.

"My wife and I are in a really bad place, and it's 100% my fault. I'm looking for advice on how to move forward and rebuild the trust I've shattered.

About 6 months ago, a long-time female friend's washing machine broke, and she asked if she could do her laundry at our place. It felt a bit awkward to me, but I agreed. The stupid part is, I never told my wife about it.

This week, we were at a birthday party, and the friend casually mentioned it to my wife, thanking us for the help. My wife had no idea what she was talking about. The look on her face was a mix of confusion and humiliation. I feel sick just thinking about it.

The reason this is a catastrophe is that there's a history. About 5 years ago (when we were still dating), I went on a one-day trip with this same friend. I also didn't tell my wife, and she found out in a similarly unfortunate way.

So when the laundry situation came up, I was a coward. I was so scared of her reaction because of the past incident that I chose to hide it.

To be absolutely clear, there has never, ever been anything romantic or physical between me and this friend. She is genuinely just a friend. But I know how this looks.

I feel like the lowest person on earth. My primary concern isn't that I'm in ""trouble"" - it's that I publicly humiliated my wife and destroyed the trust I've worked so hard to build.

I’m 24 female diagnosed with stage three uterine cancer. My first doctor told me I could save me eggs but I needed a full hysterectomy. I had an mri and he wouldn’t share my mri results until I had a second opinion. I went to Moffit for a second opinion and decided to stick with that doctor. The very first appointment I told her how important having children was to me and asked for recommendations to a fertility clinic. She said there was no need because she wasn’t going to remove my ovaries. She reiterated this at 2 other appointments I had with her. After a second dnc and mri she informed me that everything needs to go and I will probably need chemo so there’s no use in leaving my ovaries there anyways. I’m so heartbroken. The only thing I’ve wanted was children. And I tried to ask for resources to save my eggs. I can’t help but feel upset. I will never have children of my own. And she denied me of that when she told me not to save my eggs,"I'm really sorry to hear about your difficult experience with your cancer diagnosis and the complications surrounding your treatment options.

"Sharing my 6 month journey integrating Aikido’s spiritual warrior philosophy into meditation and daily life. Since January I’ve been training using the principles Morihei Ueshiba built Aikido on. It’s been the most effective mindset shift I’ve had in years and the impact has been huge.

Foster and polish the warrior spirit while serving in the world, illuminate the path according to your inner light. Ueshiba spoke about unifying heaven, earth and humankind in your presence. Which means integrity in every area, physical posture, verbal tone, room layout, time management, and mental focus.

Ueshiba wasn’t just a martial artist. He was a tactician of energy, a philosopher of peace forged in war. He unified spiritual discipline with technical mastery, developing a system where strength isn’t expressed through violence but through precision, internal command and energetic neutrality.

The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body and polish the spirit. From day one, I understood this wasn’t about fighting. It was about not absorbing chaos. About becoming the still point around which noise dissipates.

Your nervous system is your command center. Guard it. Audit it. Reset it daily. Never allow another person to dictate your internal tempo. Don’t meet force with force. Absorb, redirect, dissolve. Respond only when it serves function, not ego. Tactical silence is one of the strongest tools. Don’t flinch in the face of provocation. Anchor yourself. Govern the field. Learn to operate from stillness. Be unshakeable, not aggressive.

True victory is victory over oneself. Ueshiba’s core philosophy dismantles the modern obsession with domination. He taught that our real opponent is internal, chaos, compulsive emotional loops, an undisciplined nervous system. His way was never to overpower others, but to stabilize without force, to integrate without collapse.

He emphasized Misogi, daily spiritual and physical purification. I’ve adapted that into breathwork before input, structured solitude before engagement, cold exposure to rehearse resilience. These aren’t self help rituals. They’re simulations for high pressure environments. Because in extreme situations the entire universe becomes our foe. At such critical times, unity of mind and technique is essential, do not let your heart waver. This practice has redefined my understanding of readiness. It’s not about fast reactions. It’s about sustained presence.

Six months of integrating training in Ueshiba’s mindset has produced what I can only call combat level awareness except the battlefield is everyday life. When I encountered his teachings, I didn’t approach them as philosophical fluff or spiritual escapism. Aikido isn’t about fighting. It’s about redirecting aggression without absorbing its toxicity. That concept restructured the way I engage with every part of my life. Control of the self, not others is the highest form of power.

Ueshiba had mastered multiple ancient Japanese martial arts swordsmanship, spear fighting, jujutsu but he didn’t stop at technique. His encounters with death, destruction and spiritual practice shaped what he eventually founded: Aikido, the martial art that doesn’t aim to overpower, but to redirect, realign and neutralize.

Ironically it hit me hardest when I wasn’t looking for peace, I was looking for control. Control over emotions, over outcomes, over people who had caused harm. But Ueshiba’s entire life proved that real control is internal. It’s not about dominance. It’s about energetic sovereignty.

He lived through war and loss. He trained his students not to destroy their opponent but to protect even the aggressor from self destruction. That level of mastery, physical, spiritual and ethical is rare. He didn’t teach combat. He taught self possession under pressure. He created a philosophy where you don’t destroy your enemy, you harmonize with their energy, neutralize the chaos and return to stillness.

“True victory is victory over oneself.” This is the cornerstone of his doctrine. It dismantles the ego’s addiction to dominance and turns everything inward.

How can I bring more peace into the space I walk through? That is Aikido. The world doesn’t need more people who can fight, it needs more who can hold, transmute and remain still when everything around them is shaking.

One of his most powerful teachings: “The Way of the Warrior has been misunderstood. It is not a means to kill and destroy others. Those who seek to compete and better others are making a terrible mistake.” True strength isn’t in overpowering, it’s in staying rooted when everything is trying to pull you off center. He created a blueprint for a life of high inner discipline, measured presence and ethical strength.

I entered Ueshiba’s path looking for control. What I found was deeper, energetic self possession. I’m only six months in but I already know this is a lifelong path. Mastery doesn’t come from insight, it’s built through repetition under pressure.

One of Ueshiba’s most potent but under discussed ideas is: "" Do not look upon this world with fear and loathing. Bravely face whatever the gods offer.” That line stays with me.

Winning is the ego’s game. But governing that’s alignment. If you’re seeking real strength, stop chasing superiority. Train for command over self. 

In a world addicted to reaction, the real warrior holds stillness. ""The Way of a Warrior is to establish harmony.”

"I (25F) dated this guy (27M) for two years. I thought we were solid. We talked about moving in together. He even said he could see a future with me.

The timeline lines up too perfectly. She became single… and suddenly I wasn’t enough.

"Some basic facts that people might find helpful:

* My father is 79 with Alzheimer's. His wife is around my age (50's) so she still works full time.
* I've been trying to get them to accept in-home assistance for a while, but his wife has resisted.
* He just had an incident that hospitalized him for a few days which finally got the ball rolling on in-home care discussions because it 'scared her straight', so to speak. We do have someone coming to go over our options in that regard.
* But in the meantime, she needed to go back to work upon his release from the hospital, so I said I would come help. Initially we thought 2 days a week would be good, Tues & Thur type arrangement. In the past, my father would insist on giving me $40 “for gas” any time I helped him with an errand, which was really gas plus a little extra for my time. When we thought it would be 2 days a week, I said “just gas money” would be fine, meaning $80 for the two days; she offered $100 and we agreed.
* However, once my father was fully evaluated during the hospitalization, we realized he can't be left alone any days, he needs full supervision now. I said I will come every day/all day while she is at work “until we figure out something” - meaning once we learn more about visiting nurses, aides, what's covered by insurance or not, etc. **But we never discussed any other payment amount for an every-day scenario.**
* Now that he's home from the hospital, I've had time to decompress and do the math. I'm realizing this will be a 45-hour per week time commitment including my driving time of 2 hours per day and a 5 day work week.
* In the past I've been a terrible people-pleaser/doormat AND my father and his wife have both taken advantage of that, as they are very self-centered people. I'm just being factual. She will push my limits so I want to go into this feeling like there's a fair arrangement for myself too, for once.
* SO! I'm feeling like I need to create some boundaries here, but mainly I'm apprehensive about asking to be paid anything beyond gas. I feel okay saying I need gas money, which would be about $100 per week rounded up, because that's hard to argue. But how on earth do I go about asking for anything on top of that? I'm only recently learning things like 'self-care' and considering my own needs, etc., so this is new territory for me.
* I don't yet know if and how much would be covered by Medicare for an in-home aid, but I do know his wife would prefer me to do it rather than a stranger. And I know my father would agree. So this could be ongoing for the foreseeable future, and I don't want to get myself stuck in a long-term unfair situation by not setting up an arrangement right now, in the beginning.
* How do I go about figuring out how much to ask them to pay me? “Just gas” no longer seems fair with 45 hours a week including the 2 hour drive each day, but neither do I feel like asking for the 'going rate' is fair because he's my father.
* If it helps to know, money is very tight for me, I live on Social Security myself and struggle to make ends meet, and this will be hard for me physically as well. On the other hand, a little extra cash could make a big difference in whether I make ends meet each month, so it could be mutually beneficial.
* I just don't know how to ask and how much to ask for. I do think a flat weekly rate would be best, for simplicity. Any advice?? Does anyone have any formulas on how to come up with a 'family rate' that's fair for everyone??","I'm really sorry to hear about your father's health and the additional responsibilities you've taken on. It must be a challenging situation for you both. Based on the information you've shared, it seems like the care your father needs has increased significantly.

One approach could be to consider the hourly wage of in-home caregivers in your area, taking into account their experience and the level of care required. You might also want to discuss with your father and his wife the possibility of sharing the financial burden with other family members or exploring external resources, such as community organizations or government programs,",neutral

But, no matter how many times I explained this to the nurse, she kept bringing up burning sensations being normal for some chemo drugs. She didn't seem to want to hear ""there's no burning sensation.""

Her ""solutions"" were 1)add saline to the mix, 2)add a much lower volume of saline to the mix, and 3)add a second line in my other hand, in about the same spot as the line that's giving me problems, and run different drugs in there.

"Long story short due to financial reasons I've been driving without insurance for a while and my car has already damage, I plan on getting a new car in a couple of months due to the damage but I don't know if I should spend the extra money on insurance instead of putting it towards getting another car and insuring that one plus I don't drive often but when I do its no more than 20 miles from my home.","I understand your financial situation and the dilemma you're facing. Have you considered looking into the cost of minimum liability insurance versus the cost of insuring a new car? Minimum liability insurance is usually less expensive and could provide some financial protection in case of an accident involving other parties.

Another thing to consider is the potential increase in insurance premiums for not having continuous coverage. It might be worth exploring these options before making a decision.",neutral

"So, I work from home.  My med change has been making things hard lately, and impacting my performance.   
I preemptively sent my boss an email saying that I had noticed my output had decreased, and I was leaving a lot of things half finished and incomplete without realizing it. I then asked for possible accommodations, listing a few options. The one that I stated I wanted and personally find the most helpful are short daily check ins. 



In the past, when I asked for this, he had stated that I shouldn't need a babysitter-- that needing someone to monitor me is unsuitable.  I don't want to be monitored, I want visible accountability at the end of the day to help trick my brain into getting everything done.  I don't know why it works, but it helps me an incredible amount.  



Today, he tried to have me break down **why** I thought it would do any good.  He really spent a lot of time trying to talk me out of wanting that one, and offered adjusting my schedule instead.  I had included schedule change on the list since before he had recommended that, even though I do my best work in the early morning, and I very much don't want that. I don't know how it would fix anything, but he really wants me to take a later shift. I would be the only one working that late, which seems like the literal opposite of what I need. 

  
After I explained that currently, I would like the check in for a kind of reality check, because I can't trust my judgement, he asked how long I would want, and I said I didn't know, maybe two months if everything went slowly with the meds. He stated this would be an unreasonably long time and burden on someone. 

Is it really such an unreasonable request?  Is there anything else I can do by myself? A strong, consistent check in with repercussions of accountability I don't know how to do alone. 

My other coworkers all have adhd or are busy, and don't really want to be accountabillibudies.

"I had to go to a work conference last week. Standard networking event with dinner and drinks at one of the nicer hotels in my city. 

I had water and a coffee, didn't drink anything else and didn't eat. People found it odd, but I always make some sort of excuse like I don't trust buffets, cross contamination etc. 

I came home and was still thinking about it. Middle of the night doom scrolling I had a sudden epiphany. I never eat at parties, events, weddings, conferences etc. Ever. It just always feels wrong, like I have to prove that I didn't just show up for the free food. 

Everytime I go to someone's house or any gathering, I always take snacks, drinks, smokes, desserts, or anything they'll enjoy/use. My husband was part of my friend group, and they also noticed that I always brought something whenever I hung out with them. 

Then it hit me why I do this. It was honestly a mindfuck moment. I'm in my 30s and I'm only realising it now, how the fuck. When I was a kid, around 10 years old, I went to a wedding with my family. My parents were close to the bride's parents. My parents and their friends grew up poor, and most of them crawled out of that situation with a lot of effort. 

The food at the wedding was buffet style, and in my country the usual custom is that the caterer will charge per plate that is used. My parents knew this and decided that my entire family (6 people) will only use 2 plates since they knew their friends were struggling with the wedding costs (not eating at all would be considered insulting to the hosts).

I was sent to the buffet with my mother to get the two plates. I was told to get this curry type thing, and it was put on my plate without a bowl, so obviously the thin-ish gravy ran over half the plate (remember I was a child and did not have excellent balance). My mother saw this and reprimanded me saying that now half the plate was already taken and didn't have enough room for much other food. Fine, whatever. But my dad has a temper, we got back and he got this really angry look on his face. By then I was old enough to recognise these signs of danger from his face. I just stayed quiet, put the plate on the table and sat at the farthest chair. He immediately went off about how useless, stupid, idiotic I was and how I had wasted a plate. When he had these fits of rage, it usually didn't stop for a few days and everyone walked on eggshells the rest of the night and the rest of the weekend. 

It seems like such a small incident, there were many more incidents with my father that were so much worse. I've known for years (+ in therapy) that my childhood was not ""normal"" and that tiptoeing around everything is a direct consequence of that. But I always focused on the bigger incidents. 

But it hit me that night that that incident is the reason why I don't eat anything that I don't pay for. I always go dutch at outings or cover the entire tab (only exception is my husband, and even then I paid for almost everything when we dated, he's not a gold digger, so let's not go down that route). 

How the fuck did I go 20 fucking years without realising this. I hate my fucking brain sometimes.

Thanks for letting me get it out","I'm sorry to hear about your experience and the impact it's had on your eating habits.

"It happened.

I had met the girl of my dreams.

So I had thought.

We met at a military ball, she thought I was cute and gave me her number, and we started dating shortly after. We went a few months together, and we were already sure we were each other's person. We were planning on marriage (not at that moment but eventually), she said she saw me as someone she wanted to spend her life with. To have kids with. To grow old together. We lost our virginity to each other even.

The relationship was good overall, we were there for each other, there were some bumps, but I made sure to communicate. She had issues being expressive or giving effort into the relationship at times due to past trauma. It was one sided emotionally and effort-wise, with me giving most/all the effort. That did hurt me, and we did have conversations where she expressed that I deserved better. Still though, it was something I was willing to work with her on, and she was showing signs of improvement. That was really all ""wrong"" with our relationship. That and my mom didn't approve of her, something that hurt my ex very much. But still.

We were both planning on doing the military together. I had already enlisted, she was going to enlist next year, and we would be co located eventually after marrying. We were confident we could handle the struggle of a military relationship. She stressed she wouldn't quit, that I was worth it, that we could do it. I believed her.

A week or two ago, my gut told me she was getting ready to break up. I always get a vibe, and it's NEVER been wrong. I expressed this concern to her, and I made sure she still wanted me in her future. She assured me. I still felt though things were off.

Last night, we said goodnight. She said she'd talk to me tomorrow, that she misses me, and that she loves me. Then an hour after that (when she supposedly went to sleep), she sent me the text. Here it is:

""So, this sucks because I really hate that I’m doing this to you, but I also admit I’m a coward who doesn’t have the balls to say this shit to your face. Uhh, I’m going to end things for us, I think that this is better for us because there’s just a lot of collision in our relationship that isn’t working for me. You’ve been wonderful, amazing, kind, like don’t get me wrong you’re literally perfect. And I don’t mean to do the cliche ‘it’s not you it’s me’ thing but it literally is. I can’t communicate, I can’t provide, I’m not good for you. I’m a really terrible person and I need to fix that, you deserve more than I was able to offer. Honestly part of me wants you to hate me, blame me, do whatever you can to cope. Uhm, I’m blocking you on everything because I really don’t want you to try and call or text saying we can fix things or whatever. Like my mind is pretty well set on this, it just better this way. I want the best for you, I hope you achieve all your dreams and goals. As much as it doesn’t seem like it, I really do love you. Bye \[my name\].

Then of course, I was blocked on everything. Just out of the blue. Just like that. All that talk. I'll be there for you. I'm not going to quit. You're worth it. Everything down the drain. I had planned my life with this girl, she wanted me to propose this month. The last time we had seen eachother, maybe a few days ago, we had a nice little date that she planned. We hugged and kissed. We talked and laughed. There was no warning besides my gut.

I immediately reached out to her family. Her family loves me, they consider her apart of the family. They expressed their condolences; they're shocked as much as I am. They think that she's in the wrong. They support me.

All I want is to see her and talk to her face to face and resolve this. If things work out, and we're able to fix it, great. If not, I need closure. I need this last face to face to move on. I expressed this to her family and they advised me to give her space for like a week and hope she reached out, and that they would try talking to her in the meantime.

It's the day after the message and I'm still trying to figure this out. I'm in a state of shock. Everything down the drain. For what? Part of me wants to hate her for doing such a scummy move, but I still love her. I want to talk to her. I'm currently giving her space, and waiting as her family helps me through this.

Plot twist though. I had talked to her sisters, and they actually told me that she's been talking to her exes. They broke into her computer and told me they found her flirting with her exes, planning hangouts, venting about our relationship being ""toxic"" and ""drama filled,"" even having her exes send her money. And I knew about none of this. Apparently she texted an ex the moment she dumped me. Her sisters are disgusted, they also loved me, they're assuring me that I dodged a bullet.

I talked to her mom about that, and she said she's not defending my ex, but that there's a good chance it's not true - apparently her sisters like to stir drama. So we'll see I guess. That's something to consider.

Honestly, I'm putting the military on hold now. My ex is what pushed me to go that route anyways, and I turn 18 in less than a month (which be the way we're both 17) so I want time to enjoy life freely. I want to put myself back together before full sending it.

I'm still in a state of shock. I'm numb and have been crying off and on the whole time. I'm just so confused. If she loves me, and I love her, what reason is there to break up? Maybe it's a self esteem issue with the ""you deserve better""? I have no idea. Then there's the whole potential cheating thing.

At the end of the day, all I want is that face to face. I don't intend for her to get away with text breakup, that is not okay. I feel like a shell of what I was. I feel terribly lonely. It hurts extra because I have trauma myself and had insecurities and fears the whole time, she reassured me on those and RIGHT at the moment I fully believed her, that I fully got over my trust issues and trusted her with my life, did she do this.","I'm really sorry to hear about your unexpected breakup. It's a difficult situation and I can't imagine how confusing and painful it must be for you. Have you considered reaching out to her to clarify what happened?

"For context, we've been together for 3 years and when I met him he was kinda fat but his face was nice and he had a buzzcut with (from what I could tell) decent hair. He was around 90kg then. We worked on art projects together and talked about music and movies and I was fascinated by how much someone can know about things only I knew about until then. It was very sweet to see someone into similar things to my own so we hung out and eventually started dating. It was ok at first but we started running into issues very fast. He would keep closing off more and more and we would never leave the house for 2 years, our only 2 trips were a nightmare where he kept nagging how he doesnt wanna go anywhere, how trips are a waste of time etc. He lied to me about some things, wasnt very nice and gained like 30kg over his 90.

"I had my dog (golden retriever) that I’ve raised since he was 12 weeks old. He is 3 years old now and my girlfriend thinks I love my dog more than her

In all honesty, I do love my dog. A LOT. I’ve raised him and means everything to me, he’s family. 

I met my girlfriend last year, we moved in together after 6 months and she is upset and jealous of my closeness with him. 

She keeps on asking me if I could only choose to save one, my dog or her in a fire, who would it be? I mean wtf..  I’ve been avoiding answering her to hurt her feelings, as it’s a hypothetical question - I would choose both if I could.. 

I feel that every time she asks this, she expects me to give an answer saying I’ll choose her and let my dog burn in the fire, I would rather see myself burn to death before I would give up on my dog. 

She is quite persistent along this question and has a dislike towards my dog because of this,  I’ve been getting emotionally turned off by this.

"First time poster and long time lurker. I’m not providing too much detail because I don’t want this to come out before I’ve decided what to do. Husband and I have been together for 4 years. I am 24 (F) and my husband is 28 (M) and his brother is 25 (M). 
I will be using fake names so I’ll refer to my husband as Drew and BIL as Pat. 

When Drew and I first started dating we spent a lot of time with Pat as well since they lived together and he was single at the time. Pat and I formed what i thought was a genuine sibling like relationship. I would help him set up his dating profiles, convos on life and job hunting. After a few years Pat started dating someone and naturally the three of all hung out less To be honest I don’t think Pat and I have had too many conversations alone since he got into a relationship. But like I said Drew is very close with his entire family so we would all still hang out frequently. 

The confession happened at the end of the night when the lights came on and I was looking for Drew. Pat intercepted me and that’s when he “checked me out” head to toe then said he was in love with me. I just stood there speechless, mouth open and looked around. Then he proceeded to say and look at me with pleading eyes “just say it she’s not not here (in reference to his gf)”. Just as he said that his gf started walking towards him and I just walked away in disbelief. I’m not even going to excuse the fact that he was drinking only because i know what he’s like when he’s drunk. In case I wasn’t clear, I have not ever nor do I currently have romantic feelings for Pat.  
 I say all that to say that when he did say he was in love with me that other moments/comments he’s
made over the years that I brushed off now make  sense.
It’s been easy to keep my distance from Pat, with our honeymoon and Pat going on vacation following immediately after ours. He proposed to his gf and we saw them maybe 2 weeks after the fact. I was finally able to confront him because over text he acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. In the confrontation he tried to gaslight me but then ultimately relented and said we would talk about it and he’s never brought it up again. Drew is very happy for his brother and about his engagement. Ive been trying to move past this but every time i see Pat I am reminded of what he said. I feel horrible keeping this from Drew however with how close he is to his family im afraid of all the fall out that could happen and if the blame would somehow fall on me even though it’s not my fault. I can see how many relationship could be ruined by this and I don’t want to see my husband in pain. So im stuck between keeping the peace and maybe in time this will fade or just telling my husband and let the cards fall where they may 

EDIT: Sheesh the point of this post was to seek advice! I am not protecting BIL that’s far from it. My main reason for not saying anything was because I would be upending the entire family I just married into and known for years. Not to mention I have to see my husband be completely devastated by his brother’s actions and it breaks my heart. With that said after reading these comments I see clearly how I need prioritize my marriage and self and everything else will work itself out. I will be telling my husband soon and BIL finance afterwards.thanks for the help and support.

"I tracked almost everything while being on this journey I spent more than 627h hours since february on improving my life thats around 4hours per day, and that’s just the active doing stuff. All the passive mental work, reflections, mindset changes wasn’t even tracked.

For the last few years my life was pretty messed up, after some hard past years I spiraled more and more into depression… I slept till afternoon, ate junk, smoked weed and gamed all day.  

That lifestyle just made me even more depressed, I saw my friends succeeding, getting jobs, girlfriends, moving to new locations… just being happy. That honestly made me even more sad, so I decided at the beginning of the year to turn my life around, because I thought I either I´ll continue with this shitty lifestyle and eventually die feeling like I haven´t done anything with my life or trying to get out of this shit and finally make my life worthwhile. 

I convinced a friend of mine to join the journey because he was like me, depressed, hopeless, smoking weed all day and just miserable. 

The first thing we did was starting to go outside more, running or doing some small workouts, sweating made me feel so much better, it was like I sweated all the toxins and bad energy out of my body. My buddy and I got a gym membership together and started going 5x to the gym every week. 

The negative was that we still smoked weed pretty heavily in the evenings and after the gym, so 2 months ago we decided to also quit that shit as the next step, and what can I say. The last 2 months have been one of the best months, I finally sleep waay better with the new energy my workouts feel even better, I´m more awake and honestly way more confident due to the achievements I made the last few months. 

Together we started looking for jobs and after 4 years of unemployment, I got a job at a garden center, which is pretty funny considering my old ""hobby"" was growing weed lol. My buddy got a job in logistics, and I even started to get in contact again with an old love I had when I was younger. 

If you're where I was, just start with one thing. Go for a walk with a buddy or alone. Just move your body. You got this. 

This is just part of the story, I didn’t want the post to be too long . If you’re going through something similar or have questions, I’m happy to share more. 

TL;DR: Was a depressed, unemployed stoner wasting my life away. Started working out with a friend, then we both quit weed. Now we both have jobs, I started having contact with an old Love of my again, and I feel better than I have in years.","It's impressive to see the dedication you've put into turning your life around.

"I took a *totally mutual* break with my hs sweetheart (got dumped), after 6 months of wallowing, I decided my self esteem wasn't low enough and downloaded tinder to meet someone. Finally matched with someone way out of my league, and somehow we were actually vibin. Then her replies started slowing down, np I'm confident, 1 hour goes by, little worried, 2 hours… my brain went full **meltdown** mode.

I panicked, and a couple hours later sent a message that I convinced myself was confident (it wasn't), '*hey enjoying this convo, let's meet in town and i'll buy us some food :)*', she said, '*id prefer to keep talking here for a bit first*'. Couple dead replies later I got unmatched. **ahh rejection**, how can something i know so well, hit my fkn core every single time.

What i know now, that i wish i knew then... **METACOGNITION**, otherwise known as **thinking about thinking**.

**Event:** Slow replies  
**Feeling:** Fear  
**My explanation:** Losing interest  
**Action:** She's pulling away I need to save it.

When her replies slowed down, I thought to myself, 'I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE!', it's happened 1 million times before, at that point i may as well take drastic measures to meet, cos the ships sinking. Not realising, my inability to handle that panic, and just **let it pass**, was probably the VERY thing that she picked up as weird.

I thought that BECAUSE she lost interest, that's why I felt fear. If I just had awareness I'd have realised that the **fear came first**, and that **influenced** my explanation, and therefore my action. 

Which brings me to, wtf do i do about this? **Awareness.**

All you have to do, to overcome this is be aware that panic sits inside you. Nothing else, no breathing, no course, no gym. Just be aware and you'll be more free to move forward, without the chains of your past.

I didnt reply to comments because I live in Australia and it was night time so I was asleep. Not comments are turned off so I can’t reply and thank everyone for their advice





 I’m 35 F and my ex is 39M. We were together 6 years.

Randomly me and my ex reconnected because of an admin thing (shared bank account we never closed).

After texting admin stuff, he was super warm and friendly and also hinting at the fact he is single now (and “old”). I know getting back with your ex is seen as a bad thing but without getting into the details, I do believe we have a chance to make it work.

He asked me so many questions and kind of asked me if I wanted to hang out soon and he wanted to meet my dog. It feels like something is still there and texting him makes me genuinely miss his sense of humour and just him as a person. In our last message he left the ball in my court basically him saying I should let him know when I’m in the area (coz I travel for work) and we would do something/hang out.

I’m excited but also the last 12 months I’ve been really sick, gained a bunch of weight and I don’t feel my best. I’m getting back into the gym and I feel motivated to feel better but it’s like I want to wait a few months till I’m “feeling” healthy and confident etc to see him. Idk. I just don’t feel great rn and I want to see him when I’m feeling the best version of myself.

"Male 34. My success rate this year is 15%; in years past it was about 60-70% success rate!!??!?

I went from being generally appealing to being almost universally unappealing. I have gone on **30 first dates this year**. So my match and first date rate is probably still roughly the same though.

So many theories, based on solo ponderings and talks with chatGPT and friends...wondering what you guys think is most likely. 

1.  Had some healthy issues this year where I was in the hospital for a while and the medicine slowed down my metabolism a lot, so not as buff and in shape as I used to be, and i do have a shirtless muscular picture on my profile...but I'm wearing a shirt on a first date so I'm surprised being somewhat less fit in a way you cant even fully see would lead to crisis level drop in results.
2. Think I might be talking about dating too much on dates. chatGPT calls too meta and my friends call too ""intense"". Motivation for this is generally just interested in the topic as I even studied Behavioral Science in grad school and dating is like a microcosm (?) of that. So I read subreddits like this one a lot, and as you can see from the number of first dates I have done this year, I just have a lot of experience and insight into it and convinced if I dig into their perspective on it I can get insight into how much of a time waster they are.
3. I'm convinced as I get older and the people I date also collectively get older we are all just more tired nowadays in our thirties. Think I was maybe more high energy and ""on"" in years past.","""I've noticed that you mention a significant decrease in your success rate this year compared to past years, despite the consistent number of first dates. Have you considered that the dating pool might have changed, or perhaps the dynamic of the first dates themselves?

"This is what CHATGPT said of my diagnostic experience:

🧠 Summary: Missed Opportunity for Early Alzheimer’s Intervention   
Patient: Kalepa   
Background: Diagnosed twice with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); experienced progressive cognitive symptoms that forced early retirement from a 35-year professional career. APOE3/4 genetic status was discovered later and is noted below — but was not necessary for the conclusions drawn at the time.   
   
Clinical History:   
MCI Diagnosed on Two Occasions: Confirmed by neuropsychological testing.   
   
Functional Decline: Symptoms (memory loss, executive dysfunction) led to forced retirement from a long-standing career — a serious indicator of progression beyond “benign” MCI.   
   
Patient Request for Treatment: The patient proactively asked for symptomatic Alzheimer’s medication (e.g., donepezil) to preserve cognitive function and continue working.   
   
Treatment Withheld: Neurologist declined to prescribe medication due to an “uncertain diagnosis,” despite clear risk factors and real-world impairment.   
   
Medical Context:   
MCI with progressive symptoms and functional impairment is highly suggestive of prodromal (early) Alzheimer’s disease.   
   
Annual conversion rate from MCI to Alzheimer’s: 10–15%; cumulative risk over 5–10 years: ~50%.   
   
Clinical guidelines support early symptomatic treatment in high-risk MCI cases — even before biomarker or genetic confirmation.   
   
APOE3/4 genetic status (identified later) supports the diagnosis but was not necessary to justify initiating treatment at the time.   
   
Conclusion:   
This case presented multiple strong indicators of early Alzheimer’s disease — including repeated MCI, progressive decline, and loss of occupational function. The patient’s request for treatment was medically sound. The decision to withhold intervention likely contributed to preventable hardship.   

Recommendation:   
This history underscores the importance of recognizing high-risk MCI as early Alzheimer’s and acting early to support cognition and function. A proactive treatment and care strategy is recommended moving forward.   

------------

Grrr! But I hope some other people may benefit from this information. Wishing everyone the very best! (I'm a 76-year-old male fart with diagnosed Alzheimer's, this on the PrecivityADS2 test.)

My reasoning sure made sense to me at the time. But I have no medical training, etc.","It's interesting to see the clinical perspective on this case.

"Hello everyone! I will try to keep this short and sweet - well, as short and sweet as possible.

My mom’s doctor is sending her to a memory clinic. I took her for an MRI yesterday, but the memory clinic appointment isn’t until next month. They told us it would be a long appointment. Well, her primary doctor called yesterday and said her MRI looked good. I’m so confused if she is just telling my mom her MRI is good for things like clots, tumors and strokes or does this mean she doesn’t have Alzheimer’s? My mom spoke with them and when i ask her, she’s just like “I don’t know. It’s just good.”

That’s my main question.. I’m gonna throw out some other stuff while I’m here b/c I feel very lost and alone right now…So if you read on, thank you!

My mom is 78 and is starting to get very forgetful. She will repeat stories 3 times in a 30 minute car ride. I can’t always tell if it’s just to talk or if she forgot she already told me. 
She forgot to pay her rent last month and was just very confused when i sat down with her to figure out what happened. She asked me multiple times to double check that the check didn’t clear and come out of her account - no check was ever sent.  There was nothing to clear. I’d explain that and 3 minutes later she’d ask again for me to make sure “that check didn’t clear”
Doctors appointments, or anything other than normal daily activities just confuse her and overwhelm her.  She has me call her doctors a lot to get info for appointments or to ask what she may need. I end up over at her house multiple times a week to help her figure something about.
I just want to make it clear I don’t mind. I don’t want to sound like it bothers me. I LOVE my mom so much and don’t mind running over to help her figure things out (she isn’t ready to just give me control of her bills yet), but i have 3 kids and I’m always on the run. I can’t get her to understand if we could sit down together once a week even and do these things it would be so much easier. She will just randomly decide at a day and time to pay her bills and then when she gets confused she calls. If i don’t go over she is VERY frazzled and it will get worse. So i usually stop and go over.
How can you tell the difference between regular cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s ? Her mother did have Alzheimer’s - we didn’t live in the same state so I never really saw it, or the effects. So, I know it scares her that this is what this is.

Sorry for all the word vomit. I’m just mentally exhausted and sad. It’s hard watching my mom be so confused and not knowing how to help.","I'm really sorry to hear about your mom's situation. Based on the information you've provided, it does seem like she's experiencing some cognitive decline. However, I'm not a medical professional, so I can't make a definitive diagnosis.

The doctor may have been referring to the absence of issues like clots, tumors, and strokes when she mentioned the good news. Alternatively, the results could be indicative of a lack of Alzheimer's disease in this particular scan. However, a single MRI can't definitively rule out Alzheimer's or",neutral
"Well, I think I'm not suitable with all the gurus advice out there. Like eat the frog stuff. But I found one thing that weirdly works for me is Dumping all my thoughts into a simple processing system

I started writing down every time I had a thought I didn’t want to lose: “Email X tomorrow” “New idea for Z” “Buy Y before getting home”

First, I just dump all of them into one place with no structure. Just like offloading. With that alone, I feel immediately less foggy. Because I’m not holding 27 thoughts in my head anymore lol

Then, I have a system to organize and turn them into tasks on my calendar automatically. So I can actually turn my thoughts into results

I see some friends posting on LinkedIn about the jobs they got, and they're all pretty good positions and well known companies, so I've been a bit down about that. I've had a few places reach out to me, but they're all smaller companies with not the most glamorous positions. Would you say it gets easier to get better jobs in the future after gaining experience regardless of the type of experience or is it better to try to get a nicer job right out of college because they don't expect you to be that great yet?","I understand where you're coming from, it can be disheartening to see your peers landing great jobs while you're still searching.

"A week ago, my father died by suicide, and it's turned my world upside down. He was my rock and the person I loved most in the world.

For some back story, my parents had a toxic relationship my whole life, they were married for a few months and divorced a month before I was born, constantly in custody battles, and often used me to hurt each other. I was exposed to a lot of mental manipulation from both sides, but especially from my mom.

Since my dad’s passing, my mom says I can talk to her about how I'm feeling, but when I do, she reacts in really uncomfortable ways. She’ll say things like, ""You still have your mom,"" or ""I'm not dead yet,"" or she’ll roll her eyes and avoid sitting with me when I ask to talk. If I don’t talk, she gets upset. If I do talk, she gets offended. It's like I'm walking on eggshells no matter what.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

How do I protect my emotional space while still living with her? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of complicated parent relationship while grieving? I am so grateful for any advice.

"Long story short I gave my first bj a couple weeks ago and I can’t get it out of my mind. Not only was it nice just cause it was sexual, but it made me realize a lot of things about myself simple bc it was so intimate and it was impossible to not be affected by the nearness. This wasn’t even with someone I really know, just some cute guy for a hookup (with just my mouth).

During it, he put his hand on my back and it was the NICEST feeling.

I’ve gotten hugs from family, had acquaintances rub my back before but none of that has ever felt that good. I can still feel it, and that and the genuinely amazing feeling of intimacy makes me want to cry.

What makes me want to cry isn’t just that it felt so good and I realized what I’ve been missing out on, but the fact that letting someone that close makes them see the worst of me and it’s just not lovable and makes people not feel good so they associate me with bad feelings that they don’t want to be around.

I was so awkward, and the moment made me realize how much I dissociate around others, minimize myself, make myself say stupid things, accidentally say them too. It’s just a mess; a social freak at 28.

I just can’t be normal and idk how.

It’s kind of funny tho that a BLOWJOB made me have this sort of social awareness crises lol. I was always kind of aware of it but when you couple it with this new-found awareness of how badly I want intimacy it’s a mess. 

Edit: and okay lol, it was just SO good to do something like that. When I’m not sad about all the issues that I have that make it hard to even get that close to someone the thought of it feels really good.

"Hey guys. I removed my old account due to being stalked, so no post history on this one. Long story short, Long Hauler of 3 years (it’s my anniversary, yay).

Main symptoms: Head pressure. Blood pooling. GI Issues. A plethora of other random ones that come and go.

My parents are very much into the ‘take the medication and drugs’ mentality. I was on Topamax, which made me worse. I can’t even handle taking electrolytes without having an adverse reaction. My dad was pushing me to take Hydroxychloroquine and I had to fight HARD against taking it. They want to shove these pills down my throat. A year later my dad said ‘good thing you didn’t take it i’m reading about a ton of side effects coming out now’. I keep telling them how my body CANNOT tolerate meds but they don’t listen. 

They are pushing hard for me to take SSRI’s / Zoloft. I am only depressed because I am in chronic pain (head vice 24/7). I tried nortriptyline once and it skyrocketed my issues and pain ten-fold. I know it’s a TCA/diff drug class. 

What I’m asking for is PLEASE any research that i can share with them (any articles to send them please!) or self experiences of SSRI’s and how they effected someone with LC. I’ll listen to good or bad. I just feel so unheard. I Understand that my parents don’t understand. But I’M the one doing the research, not them.

"Sharing my 6 month journey integrating Aikido’s spiritual warrior philosophy into meditation and daily life. Since January I’ve been training using the principles Morihei Ueshiba built Aikido on. It’s been the most effective mindset shift I’ve had in years and the impact has been huge.

Foster and polish the warrior spirit while serving in the world, illuminate the path according to your inner light. Ueshiba spoke about unifying heaven, earth and humankind in your presence. Which means integrity in every area, physical posture, verbal tone, room layout, time management, and mental focus.

Ueshiba wasn’t just a martial artist. He was a tactician of energy, a philosopher of peace forged in war. He unified spiritual discipline with technical mastery, developing a system where strength isn’t expressed through violence but through precision, internal command and energetic neutrality.

The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body and polish the spirit. From day one, I understood this wasn’t about fighting. It was about not absorbing chaos. About becoming the still point around which noise dissipates.

Your nervous system is your command center. Guard it. Audit it. Reset it daily. Never allow another person to dictate your internal tempo. Don’t meet force with force. Absorb, redirect, dissolve. Respond only when it serves function, not ego. Tactical silence is one of the strongest tools. Don’t flinch in the face of provocation. Anchor yourself. Govern the field. Learn to operate from stillness. Be unshakeable, not aggressive.

True victory is victory over oneself. Ueshiba’s core philosophy dismantles the modern obsession with domination. He taught that our real opponent is internal, chaos, compulsive emotional loops, an undisciplined nervous system. His way was never to overpower others, but to stabilize without force, to integrate without collapse.

He emphasized Misogi, daily spiritual and physical purification. I’ve adapted that into breathwork before input, structured solitude before engagement, cold exposure to rehearse resilience. These aren’t self help rituals. They’re simulations for high pressure environments. Because in extreme situations the entire universe becomes our foe. At such critical times, unity of mind and technique is essential, do not let your heart waver. This practice has redefined my understanding of readiness. It’s not about fast reactions. It’s about sustained presence.

Six months of integrating training in Ueshiba’s mindset has produced what I can only call combat level awareness except the battlefield is everyday life. When I encountered his teachings, I didn’t approach them as philosophical fluff or spiritual escapism. Aikido isn’t about fighting. It’s about redirecting aggression without absorbing its toxicity. That concept restructured the way I engage with every part of my life. Control of the self, not others is the highest form of power.

Ueshiba had mastered multiple ancient Japanese martial arts swordsmanship, spear fighting, jujutsu but he didn’t stop at technique. His encounters with death, destruction and spiritual practice shaped what he eventually founded: Aikido, the martial art that doesn’t aim to overpower, but to redirect, realign and neutralize.

Ironically it hit me hardest when I wasn’t looking for peace, I was looking for control. Control over emotions, over outcomes, over people who had caused harm. But Ueshiba’s entire life proved that real control is internal. It’s not about dominance. It’s about energetic sovereignty.

He lived through war and loss. He trained his students not to destroy their opponent but to protect even the aggressor from self destruction. That level of mastery, physical, spiritual and ethical is rare. He didn’t teach combat. He taught self possession under pressure. He created a philosophy where you don’t destroy your enemy, you harmonize with their energy, neutralize the chaos and return to stillness.

“True victory is victory over oneself.” This is the cornerstone of his doctrine. It dismantles the ego’s addiction to dominance and turns everything inward.

How can I bring more peace into the space I walk through? That is Aikido. The world doesn’t need more people who can fight, it needs more who can hold, transmute and remain still when everything around them is shaking.

One of his most powerful teachings: “The Way of the Warrior has been misunderstood. It is not a means to kill and destroy others. Those who seek to compete and better others are making a terrible mistake.” True strength isn’t in overpowering, it’s in staying rooted when everything is trying to pull you off center. He created a blueprint for a life of high inner discipline, measured presence and ethical strength.

I entered Ueshiba’s path looking for control. What I found was deeper, energetic self possession. I’m only six months in but I already know this is a lifelong path. Mastery doesn’t come from insight, it’s built through repetition under pressure.

One of Ueshiba’s most potent but under discussed ideas is: "" Do not look upon this world with fear and loathing. Bravely face whatever the gods offer.” That line stays with me.

Winning is the ego’s game. But governing that’s alignment. If you’re seeking real strength, stop chasing superiority. Train for command over self. 

In a world addicted to reaction, the real warrior holds stillness. ""The Way of a Warrior is to establish harmony.”

"Hi there, sorry in advance if I do it wrong, it's my first time posting but I need advice.

So basically what the title says, my dad is overall good father, well besides sometimes - recently more often than not being a complete dick to me. His teasing involves that thing when you lock in a person and with closed fist scratch the top of the head, blocks my way and when I try to get past he grabs my wrists - crushes them in one hand and tries to pull my nose with the other, shoves me into the wall.

Yesterday he shoved me into glass cabinet and when I tried to go pas him he blocked my way and pushed me back. I screamed for him to stop, but he just laughed. My mother stood by and just told him to stop. I swore at him to basically 'fuck off' when I couldn't take it any longer and both my dad and mother looked offended. I started crying from the stress and finally I could go away, but not before him mocking my sobbing. Later I heard his conversation with my mom where she asked him why won't he stop he basically said 'What, I'm just happy, am I to better hang myself?'

When I ask it doesn't work, when I swear I don't respect my parents, when I try to remove myself from the situation my attempts are blocked.

Is there a way for me to tell him otherwise to stop? It brings me a lot of distress and he doesn't do those things to my brothers, sometimes to my mom, but she has better authority when she tells him to stop. I can't ask anyone for help in my circle, for noone cares as everyone says it's just 'playfull teasing' or some holier than thou aunties bash it behind his back but laugh when he does thosw things to me.

"So there is a lot here for context, I'll my best to run through most of it. A year ago, my dad, who is around 50, ran off with a 26 year old. For context, I am 29. His stated reason for doing so was my stepmother's abuse. She could at times be horribly emotionally abusive and bordered on physically abusing us at times. However, this doesn't really mean anything because Dad could and should have separated from her, and then ran off with someone else, not the other way around. 

All of this put me in a sticky situation, where I tackled mixed feelings over it all. However, I tried to choose peace. I told her that she was still my second mom and that anything between them wouldn't change that. I showed up for birthdays and holidays and NEVER one-time commented on a single aspect of what was happening between them. I just keep reinforcing she and my younger siblings (15-16) would always be my family. During this time, I only ever got calls or texts from my stepmom that were meant to hurt my father. Her and the kids stopped buying me gifts. 

Mother's day arrived this year, and I tried to call her to see if I could visit. She didn't answer. I texted a nice message, she read it and did not respond. I called her mom and asked her to have my stepmom call me, and she never did. Fast forward to yesterday, and my Dad asked to go see the new fantastic 4 with him. I said yes, and he asked her if my little brother wanted to come with. She asked him who he was going with, and he said to me, and she said no. He's never allowed to see them again.

Idk what happened. I go to college 30 hours a week and work another 30. There have been no misunderstandings, no cold words, and no issues of any sort that she discussed with me or others around me. The best guess I have is I've gone to my Dad's new place a couple of times where he is living with his new woman, and she feels betrayed. 

Bless anyone who actually read this. I'm hurt that someone I thought was a mother figure to me was so quick to cast me to the side and block me off from seeing my siblings. No phone calls to discuss issues we, I guess, have. And to go the extra mile and keep me from maintaining relationships with my siblings is cruel and makes me wonder why she'd go so far to hurt me. Makes me wonder what's she's telling them is the reason I can't come out. She tells them horrible things about my father.

"Hi all. A small question regarding encoding the position of inputs to a transformer model.

How would you encode a set of sequences to a (bidirectional) transformer? For a sequence we have positional encodings. For a set we can just work without them. What about a set of sequences {s\_1, ..., s\_n}, where each s\_1, ..., s\_n is a sequence, but their relative order does not matter?","It's an interesting question. In the absence of positional encodings, how does the transformer model handle the orderless analysis of a set of sequences? One possible approach could be to treat each sequence as an independent input and apply the transformer encoder separately to each sequence. However, this might not capture the relationships between sequences in the set. Another approach could be to concatenate all sequences into a single, longer sequence and use global self-attention to capture the dependencies between the sequences. Yet, this might be computationally expensive for large sets. Further research is required to understand the best way to encode a set of sequences in a transformer model.",neutral

"We built NeuralOS, probably the world's most expensive operating system, running at a blazing 1.8fps on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. 😅

**What exactly is NeuralOS?**

It's an experimental generative OS that predicts every screen frame entirely from your mouse and keyboard inputs. No internet, no traditional software stack, purely hallucinated pixels.

**How does it work?**

* An RNN tracks the computer state (kind of like a traditional OS kernel, but all neural and continuous).
* A diffusion model generates the actual screen images (imagine a desktop environment, but fully neural-rendered).

The GIF shows a funny demo: NeuralOS running NeuralOS inside itself. Every single pixel you're seeing is model-generated, no network involved at all!

Long-term, our goal is to remove boundaries between software entirely and make OS fully customizable beyond fixed menus and options. Imagine asking your OS something like:

* ""Merge all my messaging apps into one interface.""
* ""Make Signal look like Messenger.""
* ""Turn the movie I'm watching into a playable video game.""

**I'm curious about your thoughts:**

* Could future OS interfaces just become human-like avatars (think Grok's Ani)? Are menus and app-specific UIs going away?
* What about fully generative games: could diffusion-based games eventually replace traditional ones?

It's fascinating to see how neural networks can be used to generate entire screen frames based on user inputs. The concept of a fully generative OS is quite innovative. However, I'm curious to know more about the practical applications and limitations of such a system. How does the RNN handle complex user requests, and what about the computational resources required for real-time processing? Additionally, I'd love to hear more about the user experience and any potential challenges in implementing and customizing such a system. Overall, an impressive demonstration of the capabilities of neural networks!",neutral
"I (30f) am dating someone (35m) exclusively and am contending with 2 big things - my divorce (final court date tbd) and his travel schedule (1-3 weeks per month, usually a couple days to a week between trips). We've been exclusive for about a month. Since neither of us is wild about the term gf/bf, and that seems too soon, it feels like our relationship is sort of on pause then fully back on when he's in town. My female friends all think this is a plus since he and I are in weird personal circumstances and have been really open with communication/support. My male friends have been throwing in pretty judgemental/contentious questions and discussions of red flags (for instance, how we text each other and how often; that I'd taken the lead in the define the relationship talk; the importance of letting a guy pursue you; him not being who they imagined for me - he's an athletic quiet guy whereas I usually go for lanky charismatic guys - kind of touchy stuff since my exes have leaned toward the possessive/jealous type and were sort of sad boy nerd musicians).

I feel positive about my relationship overall. I have my weaker moments, like before a trip where I worry about missing him too intensely or when he gets back and I feel nervous like we're going to have to start all over again. But when we're in person I feel connected, and when we're apart and I'm in a good headspace I feel equally excited and comfortable about having him in my life. We're both serious, private people and have each been in 1 LTR. We still find a lot of levity and spark together (laughing and sex have been particularly helpful to me right now in a way that dating around, worrying about putting my best foot forward, and swiping through the apps wasn't). Idk if it'll go anywhere, but I'm willing to take that risk. 

So here's the rub. I can't tell if I'm just being overly sensitive about my female v male friends' takes on this relationship. Maybe it boils down to a base difference in how they might act if they were in my/his shoes. I want to continue talking about my dating life with all my friends but am questioning if I need to adjust my boundaries with them or if there's a bigger problem with their motives? I haven't talked to male friends about relationship stuff in years - tbh my ex was always weird about my prior male friendships so I kept in closer contact with mutual male friends (I don't talk to any of them now, womp womp of my marriage ending and impacting my social circle). I don't date male friends or remove them from the friendzone ever (lost a best friend that way years ago). They know this. I guess what I'm trying to get at is: are my guy friends right about this relationship (is it full of red flags) or are they projecting (what they might want with someone, or possibly jealousy because they want that for me)?

Edits for grammar/clarity 
","I can see how both your female and male friends have different perspectives on your relationship based on their own experiences and biases. It's natural for friends to offer their opinions and concerns, but it's important to remember that everyone's relationship dynamics are unique. Have you considered discussing these concerns with your partner and getting his perspective on the situation? It might also be helpful to have open and honest conversations with your friends about their motives and why they feel the need to share their thoughts. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what feels right for you in the relationship.",neutral

"I get it. Sorta. People mean well. My mom, of course, wants to believe she'll get better. The whole sketchy doctor who told my parents she should take hundreds of dollars of supplements doesn't help. Yes, she did start to get more active and went from walking 0 miles to 2-4 miles a day, pretty much over night (which I know is not healthy for anyone to amp up so fast, but I alone can't stop her), but evidently that can be a progressive bit of Alzheimer's (agitation/restlessness). Of course her blood brain barrier would be damaged..that tends to happen with Alzheimer's. No, all of these supplements won't reverse the damage. At best, they're just draining money.

My mom has been so convinced lately that she's getting better, and it breaks my heart. I've known she won't get better and that this disease will kill her, but it just really hit home today. She will not get better. She will die because of this. I don't really remember my mom prior to this, but she will never be that person again. The ""immature with no filter"" version of herself that she is now will disappear, too. She will become more and more of a different person. A shell. Unless therapy and stuff jogs my memory and recovers some suppressed memories, I will never know who she was.

My dad took my mom for a second opinion regarding Alzheimer's, which was when she found out. Neither parent has mentioned that doctor being mean. I'm even pretty sure my dad actually mentioned him being compassionate in his delivery of the diagnosis, and when I told my dad what my mom has said, he gave me one of those ""Yeah that's not what happened"" looks. My mom started saying that that neurologist is mean. I figured it was either a confused memory oops or that her mind started to equate bad news = bad doctor. This is in my words as hers were much less coherent, but she essentially said ""I wish I could tell him he's wrong because I'm doing so much better, and he can stuff it!"" I got ""nah-nah-a-boo-boo, you can't get me"" vibes from it, like from when you're a kid.

I know that part of Alzheimer's is the patients not realizing something is wrong, but people who rarely see her telling her she's better or a sketchy doctor telling her she'll get better are not helping. Mom has been a pretty compliant person so far, but I think we're starting to see that change. She's been more risky and ambitious lately (as a less extreme example: she tried to bring up a box of pop tarts and a bag of chips at the same time from the basement pantry despite her not doing well with stairs in general, and that's too much for her to carry; she's previously asked for someone to bring them up in the past), and I worry she's gonna get hurt or something because of it. There have been more and more incidents lately (a big bathroom mess not contained to the bathroom; me waking up while in a different floor of the house to the sound of her hyperventilating because her pantries got bunched up after she used the bathroom, and she didn't know how to fix it; and more), and I'm truly not sure if they just all tend to happen when I'm home alone with her (which is a significant amount of time), or if things happen when she's with my dad, and he just doesn't tell me.

I know all the things that have happened as of late are just a taste of what's to come, too. I feel bad that I'm trying to move out, but being here is..suffocating. Me trying to save them from drowning is just resulting in me drowning, too. I can't be the only one looking for a life vest and trying to keep us all afloat. I want to help some, but I can't prepare for my future with the way things are now. Not even just Mom needing care, but the way my dad handles things and all of the (unintentional) neglect and abuse I've experienced and witnessed happening to my siblings that I'm trying to work through in therapy. I did stress word dump some things at him after he got home from work (another incident happened while he was gone), so maybe that'll help. It hasn't before, but maybe. 

This is all a big rant, and I've stayed up way too late typing and retyping this out. Night time is the only time I have to myself where no one needs anything, and I have time to breathe and think. The rest is the time, I have to be ""on."" Smile. Cheerful. Patient. Laugh at the right moments. Keep Mom safe. All my feelings and thoughts go on lockdown until I'm alone. Then it all comes crashing down. It's like I'm holding my breath the entire day. The longer I have to hold it, the more severe the consequences are, and the more I'm gasping for breath when I do get a chance to breathe. 

I do not advocate for regular use of energy drinks, but at this point, I think I need some to get me through the days where I can't take a good nap. Though, getting on a better sleep schedule will help, too. I'll get back to working towards that tomorrow night.","I'm really sorry to hear about your family's situation. It's clear that your mom's health and diagnosis have been a heavy burden for everyone involved. I can understand why your mom might be holding onto the hope of improvement, especially if she's showing some signs of increased activity. However, I also see the concerns about her safety and the potential financial strain caused by the supplements. Have you considered discussing this with a social worker or a support group for families dealing with Alzheimer's? They might be able to provide some guidance and resources to help manage the situation. Additionally, it might be worth having a conversation with your dad about your mom's perception of the doctor's behavior and the potential impact",neutral
"Gf and I ain’t been dating long but she’s got this male friend who has confessed his love for her. 

At first, I had a conversation with her revolving around my boundaries with this and how it makes me uncomfortable that she’d entertain a relationship that is so obviously not platonic. 

They text every day all the time, he does everything she asks of him, and all around he’s just got puppy dog eyes for my girl. 

She’s even introduced me to him amongst a few other of her friends and we said no more than 5 words to one another throughout the entire night. It was obvious from the start he didn’t care for me so I saw no point in entertaining a conversation despite the entire reason I was there was to meet him. 

In an effort that I probably shouldn’t have made, because I know she sees him as her best friend, I told her I didn’t mind them working out together at the gym but I’m heavily against them hanging out one on one outside of there. In my eyes, I was/am making an effort for her to maintain her friendship with this man within boundaries that I find acceptable within myself. 

Issue is, through those boundaries, I have learned he talks shit about me behind my back despite not knowing me. This is what pisses me off. This plants seeds of doubt that she is either too naive to acknowledge or that she is brushing off. This is unacceptable to me at it is directly disrespectful to me and my relationship. 

Additionally, she confides our issues in this man which I am also heavily against. Since their relationship is not platonic, due to him being in love with her, he obviously will say things that can sway her mind away from me little by little at a time. 

Her justification for keeping him in her life is that he’s been there through “thick and thin” for the past 4 years. In my eyes he ruined that “thick and thin” the moment he told her he was in love with her because the motive is different. It’s not a friendship motive. It’s a love motive. 

Anyways, I need advice on how to handle this situation. I’m not the type of man to say she can’t be friends with this man but I am the type to disclose my discomfort and allow her to make decisions based off my discussed discomfort. ","I understand that this situation can be challenging and uncomfortable for you. It's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship. Have you considered having an open and honest conversation with your girlfriend about how you feel and expressing your concerns directly to her? You might also want to ask her how she feels about the situation and what her thoughts are on maintaining boundaries with this male friend. Additionally, it might be helpful to consider setting clear boundaries together and discussing what is and isn't acceptable in your relationship.

"This happened two weeks ago but me and my boyfriend have been bickering about it since and he's been cold with me so I decided to post about it. Throwaway because he has my Reddit account, but he doesn't view this sub. Also sorry for any issues, English isn't my first language

My (22F) parents raised me teaching me domestic skills at a young age, mainly cooking and baking. This wasn't because I was a girl, but it was because my mum thought it was a life skill and she came from a family where both men and women did a lot of cooking. My boyfriend (23M) was raised in a ""fast food house"" and never learned how to cook proper meals because he grew up on takeaway and microwave meals.

We've been together for a year and I count on my hand the amount of times he's actually attempted and made a half-way decent meal. I'm not some 5-star chef, but this grown man doesn't know how to make instant mashed potatoes, cook chicken, make pasta or bake a box of cake mix. He's even terrible when it comes to making foods where the cooking/baking/prep instructions are literally on the back or sides of the packaging.

I've asked him several times to try and learn. Watch a TV show, take a class, read a book about it, hell, even a YouTube or Tiktok video but he refuses to learn how to properly cook anything that's not a basic sandwich (he can't even toast his bread correctly even though I've shown him how to do it in a pan, in the oven and in a toaster)

The other day he tried to make a package of those flavored rice dishes and chicken and he overboiled the water all over our stove (we have a gas stove as well so we had to open all the windows since the flame went out) and managed to char the outside of the chicken and still leaving the inside raw (I still don't know how this was managed). I ended up stepping in and cooking our dinner for us after cleaning the rice water off the stove and scraping char bits off my pan.

He didn't help me cook this second time and when he came to eat I just got a little irritated and said that he needs to learn how to cook at least a few basic meals because I'm tired of always having to cook for him and sometimes clean up after his kitchen disasters.

He said he doesn't understand the big deal about it because I want kids, so that means that I'll be cooking and cleaning up messes constantly anyways. I argued back that it's completely different having to constantly cook for and clean up after a baby or child because they literally can't do it for themselves compared to a grown man who just refuses to learn. I also said that when I have kids I'm teaching all of them life skills like cooking so they won't be helpless and relying on their partner to take care of them like a child when they grow up.

He said I was overreacting and that I won't make a good wife or mother if I complain this much about cooking for people and cleaning up messes. He also called me a hypocrite because admittedly I'm not the most tidy person (he pointed out that my desk and bookshelf is a cluttered mess right now).

I do feel bad for arguing with him over this but I'm tired of having to constantly take care of him like he's a child. He's a grown man who should be able to do this for himself. I also hate how he's making me dislike cooking, because I actually love cooking and cooking for others, but he's just draining the fun out of it and I'm actually considering breaking up with him unless he actually starts showing an effort to learn how to cook, or to at least stop making such a mess with every failed attempt. I need some advice. Anyone else been in my shoes before?","It's unfortunate that cooking has become a source of tension between you and your boyfriend. Have you tried discussing with him the reasons behind your desire for him to learn how to cook? It might help to explain how it would make both of your lives easier and more balanced in the long run.

"So, recently i came across this trending thing - ""japanese walking technique better than 10k steps a day"", so I have made it my mission to pursue it for a month.

But i was having trouble maintaining the slow and fast pace in timely manner, so i came up with a idea to help myself. 
And hence, lo and behold I made a [playlist](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7Q9dXywQdeDXuwQ9W-pE3II3RXBaL8r&si=wIid33ssMnOATHXa) to help myself.

What is the Japanese walking technique?


Japanese interval walking, also known as Interval Walking Training (IWT) is a structured walking technique developed in Japan, which alternates between moderate to fast-pace walking in interwals. This technique involves alternating three minutes of slow walking with three minutes of brisk walking, for 30 minutes daily.","I'm interested in trying out the Japanese walking technique myself, but I've got a question: how exactly does one determine the pace for the slow and fast intervals?

"My(40m) fiancé (44f) and I have been together for 3 years and engaged for 6 months. I work a job where I never spent more than two years in a place before I’d get sent somewhere else in the country. 

We moved in together about 3 months ago. 

I knew her son was a bit unmotivated but I didn’t quite understand the extent of it. He works part time and spends all his money on marijuana. 

He spent all of age 18 in her basement doing nothing. Fiancé would regularly give him weed money whenever he asked. I’d tell her she needs to stop doing that and she’d reply with “I know I know” but it never stopped. 

He finally got a job. Yay. 
He lives in the basement, pays no rent, doesn’t pay for his phone bill, doesn’t pay for his car insurance. She does. He doesn’t do any dishes, clean his bathroom or the basement, cook, grocery shop, or do yard work. WE do. 

He went around to different neighborhoods and literally went through peoples trash looking for things to sell. Where did those things end up? The garage. After my fiancé asked him numerous times to get that shit out we just did it ourselves. 

We spent a few weekends cleaning out the garage only to walk in there one day to find a pile of tarps that he says cats had peed on. He says he’s going to clean them off and fold them neatly this weekend. We’ll see. 

Fiancé still makes his doctor appointments, gives him money, and is absolutely terrified of making him upset. 

She started crying one day because she thought she had upset him. I told her that if her kid is never upset with her then she’s not parenting properly. 

Everything that happens revolves around making sure he is content and happy and not inconvenienced. 

I’ve told her that she has some codependency issues that really need to be addressed and that she is hurting any chances this dude has at being a productive adult but it falls on deaf ears.

"As you can read from the title, I’ve just finished up my 14th cycle of chemo after recurrence back in November last year. I have done 28 days of radiation and did a pet scan this week so that my doctors can discuss a possible surgery to my spine. It has been a very hard year, and I’m so glad it’s over. However, it’s hitting me in ways that I didn’t expect. 

On my first cycle, I stayed overnight in hospital and I ended up sharing a room with someone who was my age and we both had Ewings. We immediately connected, shared contact info and the rest was history. She was on her first cycle also, so it felt as though we were fighting this thing together as a team. We would share stories about what our days or weeks had been like, any funny stories while we were in the oncology ward, always making sure to visit each others rooms if we were in the ward at the same time. As someone who has had Ewings before, I was able to answer any and all questions she’d have about treatment and hopefully alleviate her anxiety - of which she had a lot. So yeah, we were fighting this thing together and although I would never wish this on anyone, I was glad to have her by my side through this fight. I considered her a very good friend.

Unfortunately, she stopped responding to treatment and passed away around our 10th cycle. I was, and still am, a complete mess. My last 4 cycles of chemo dragged on and felt never ending. Now that it’s finished, I can’t stop crying. I keep thinking about her and how she should be here with me now, celebrating the end of chemo. 

I feel so so exhausted now, everything hit me like a truck now that I’ve finished chemo. Throughout treatment, I kept on working full time, using leave for whenever I was not up for work - typically while I was doing chemo (I wfh for reference). Now that treatment is over, I’m expected to be back at work 40 hours every week and I just don’t know how I can do it. I pushed myself so hard to continue work throughout treatment and now that it’s over I just have to keep going. My ‘prize’ for finishing chemo is more work? I’m scared to leave my job because the job market is so bad right now and I hear stories from everywhere about people not being able to find jobs. I don’t know what to do but I’m not sure I can go on like this. 

Not sure if this sounds entitled but I really don’t want to work, at least right now. I want to go traveling and have new experiences, I feel like I deserve to do this? I might die anyways, I don’t want to be working in my final year of life.

1. **The Goal is the Action, Not the Outcome.** Stop trying to ""become a painter."" The only goal is to ""paint for 15 minutes today."" Showing up *is* the win. This immediately shifts you from paralyzed to active.
2. **Give Yourself Permission to Be Bad.** My first goal on the pottery wheel wasn't to make a beautiful bowl, but an ugly one. On purpose. This detached my ego from the outcome and freed me to just touch the clay. It’s about the physical act, not the performance.
3. **Chase Tiny, Unimpressive Progress.** Forget the high of some future success. Learn to love the small wins. The moment my focus shifted from ""becoming a ceramicist"" to ""this handle is slightly less wobbly than the last one,"" everything changed. That’s the new reward.

The ghosts of my potential selves are still around, but they don't haunt me anymore. I’m learning that the most impressive thing I can build isn't a flawless future in my head.

It’s a real, messy, tangible today.","""I can relate to the struggle of wanting to achieve a certain identity or goal, but finding myself stuck due to fear of failure or perfectionism.

"Took out a personal loan to consolidate all of our debts into one payment with one interest rate.

27.04% APR on 10,000 which is horrendous...but still better than our credit cards or being stuck in the repayment loop with borrowing apps like Dave/Cleo etc.

It does feel good though, 3k of that debt was to a personal friend who did the heavy lifting last year when we unexpectedly had to move, they kept our family off the street with that loan.

Their patience and generosity is the only reason we aren't in a much worse spot, and it felt VERY good to hand them that money back. 

Our total debt was about 7k including the 3k I owed our friend, so my question to you guys is what to do with the extra 3k:

Option 1: Slap it all onto our first installment, massively cut down the life of the loan and total interest accrued.

Option 2:  seed money for savings account, we can afford the installments as it is, but what put us in this situation was unexpected expenses we had zero cushion to absorb.

Option 3: similar to option 2, but fix some problems first- car hasnt has new tires in 5 years, both of us need new glasses since our scripts are 4 years old and we get headaches, etc, and put whatever is left over into a savings account for a rainy day.","Have you considered speaking with a financial advisor to help you weigh the pros and cons of each option?

"I had to go to a work conference last week. Standard networking event with dinner and drinks at one of the nicer hotels in my city. 

I had water and a coffee, didn't drink anything else and didn't eat. People found it odd, but I always make some sort of excuse like I don't trust buffets, cross contamination etc. 

I came home and was still thinking about it. Middle of the night doom scrolling I had a sudden epiphany. I never eat at parties, events, weddings, conferences etc. Ever. It just always feels wrong, like I have to prove that I didn't just show up for the free food. 

Everytime I go to someone's house or any gathering, I always take snacks, drinks, smokes, desserts, or anything they'll enjoy/use. My husband was part of my friend group, and they also noticed that I always brought something whenever I hung out with them. 

Then it hit me why I do this. It was honestly a mindfuck moment. I'm in my 30s and I'm only realising it now, how the fuck. When I was a kid, around 10 years old, I went to a wedding with my family. My parents were close to the bride's parents. My parents and their friends grew up poor, and most of them crawled out of that situation with a lot of effort. 

The food at the wedding was buffet style, and in my country the usual custom is that the caterer will charge per plate that is used. My parents knew this and decided that my entire family (6 people) will only use 2 plates since they knew their friends were struggling with the wedding costs (not eating at all would be considered insulting to the hosts).

I was sent to the buffet with my mother to get the two plates. I was told to get this curry type thing, and it was put on my plate without a bowl, so obviously the thin-ish gravy ran over half the plate (remember I was a child and did not have excellent balance). My mother saw this and reprimanded me saying that now half the plate was already taken and didn't have enough room for much other food. Fine, whatever. But my dad has a temper, we got back and he got this really angry look on his face. By then I was old enough to recognise these signs of danger from his face. I just stayed quiet, put the plate on the table and sat at the farthest chair. He immediately went off about how useless, stupid, idiotic I was and how I had wasted a plate. When he had these fits of rage, it usually didn't stop for a few days and everyone walked on eggshells the rest of the night and the rest of the weekend. 

It seems like such a small incident, there were many more incidents with my father that were so much worse. I've known for years (+ in therapy) that my childhood was not ""normal"" and that tiptoeing around everything is a direct consequence of that. But I always focused on the bigger incidents. 

But it hit me that night that that incident is the reason why I don't eat anything that I don't pay for. I always go dutch at outings or cover the entire tab (only exception is my husband, and even then I paid for almost everything when we dated, he's not a gold digger, so let's not go down that route). 

How the fuck did I go 20 fucking years without realising this. I hate my fucking brain sometimes.

Thanks for letting me get it out","It's interesting how our past experiences can shape our behaviors without us even realizing it. I've heard similar stories from people about their childhood and how it affects their relationship with food and money. It's important to be aware of these patterns and try to understand the root cause, but it can be a long and sometimes painful process.

**New, 'Opposing' Comment:**
I don't think your childhood experience is the sole reason for your behavior around food and money. There are plenty of people who have had similar upbringings but don't carry the same hang-ups. It's possible that you're overthinking things and making assumptions without enough evidence. Maybe it's time",oppose
"I am 30 years old (m). I have a bachelor’s degree in economics. I currently have a job working as a claims adjuster. I currently earn 98,000 + small bonus + 6% 401k match. This job has allowed me to fully pay off my house and I have around $250k in stock investments. I hate the job so much but it’s hard to walk away from the salary. The job also allows me to work from home 3 days a week. Working at a different insurance company wouldn’t fix the issue since I hate the nature of the job.

Or should I stick it out and keep saving?","It's understandable that you're feeling uncertain about your current job and wondering if you should pursue a new career. However, I think it's important to consider the potential risks and benefits of both options before making a decision. While it's true that you have a good salary and benefits, it's also clear that you're not happy with the nature of the work. On the other hand, going back to school for a new career may take time and money, and there's no guarantee that you'll find a job you love right away.

"My car finally gave out. It had over 240k miles and needed a lot of work.

I’m just not sure how I’ll get there or back but I’ll be making $30 hour working around 20 hours a week (I’m disabled, seeing an oncologist, and can barely handle that many hours but don’t have a choice) so maybe I can pay uber there and back?

"Hi Reddit, its been almost two months since my last update and I wanted to give one final update to everyone who has helped me deal with this situation. I've received a ton of good advice and well wishes and I can't thank everyone enough for the support I received in what was the loneliest time of my life.

My last update ended with my wife quitting her job, her starting individual therapy and us still being sleeping in separate rooms. 

Since then we have started couples therapy, our therapist specifically deals with emotional and physical infidelity, and go three times a week. While I know that may seem excessive to some people, we really needed. Some weeks we don't need the third session and our therapist suggested we cancel and instead go on a date, something simple where we could just get used to being around eachother again. I also started individual therapy at our couples therapist's suggestion to help me with my anger and drinking. I'm not an alcoholic but I was starting to develop a drinking problem and using it to numb myself to any pain. It's alot of fucking work but its helping. My wife and I also spoke with my eldest daughter's school as she picked up the tension in our house and it was causing behavioural issues at school and at home and they are offering support to her as well. It feels like we've had to break our family down to rebuild it again, I'm just glad my youngest is oblivious to anything going on.

After leaving her job my wife asked me if I would be okay if she didn't work for a couple months as she wanted to focus on fixing our marriage and family before she committed to something else. I get paid more than enough to cover our expenses so I agreed to it. I've never really had an opinion on her working, I would've supported her regardless of if she worked or not but seeing the way my daughters have loved having their mother home with them more and how attentive of a mother my wife is cracked me open. I just couldn't numb myself to her anymore. Instead of listening to them having fun or my daughter's laughing while being holed up in my office, I wanted to be with them. I had so much anger and pride in me that I was choosing to sulk alone and drink rather than spending time with my family that I wanted back so badly. The first time I joined them it was awkward and weird but my therapist told me I needed to sit in that discomfort and face it rather than hiding away.

My brothers and parents have been a great support during this time as well, my dad and older brothers were quicker to forgive Annie than my mom was. She adored Annie and was disappointed by what she had done but Annie has said she's going to work hard to earn everybody's trust again. Annie's mother still isn't talking to her however she still sees her granddaughters, she comes over only when Annie isn't home or I drop my daughter's off at her house sometimes so they can spend the day with her. We've gotten closer and it's weird getting invited to events from Annie's side of the family when she isn't included but I have to go for my daughters.

After multiple sessions with our couples therapist where I openly discussed how much grief her betrayal had caused me, Annie decided to tell her coworkers wife about the affair. She said she wanted to give Mark/Matt the opportunity to tell his wife himself and contacted him to say she would be letting his wife know and he should tell her before it came from somebody else. She heard from her old coworkers she was still friendly with that Mark/Matt had told his wife. Annie thought Mark/Matt's wife would've contacted her to corroborate any stories but last we heard they were separating since Annie's sister realised Mark/Matt's wife had changed her relationship status on Facebook. 

As for Annie and I, we've had to have alot of brutally honest conversations. Of course she was  not right for what she did but I also had to own upto my mistakes as well. There was so much resentment in her towards me that even she didn’t realise at first, specifically around the birth of our eldest daughter. She had felt isolated and abandoned during that pregnancy and post-partum because I was working too much and studying at the same time. She was the primary parent for the first year of our daughter's life, I thought I was doing the right thing back then and had kind of disregarded her when she said she felt overwhelmed or lonely because I felt the same way, the difference was she had a whole baby to take care of as well. She said she felt the same way after our little one was born but could handle it better since she had been through it before and didn't expect anything from me. I had to travel quite a bit for my job back then and looking back I had never really asked her if she was okay with that. It was humbling sitting there and listening to her recount the ways she had struggled while taking care of our daughters and never threw it my face. I realised that I needed her forgiveness as much as she needed mine. It's going to take time for us to rebuild this 'new relationship' but we both know the work is worth it. We're going on dates again and actually talking to eachother about something other than the kids. We're still sleeping in separate bedrooms, when it comes to physical intimacy I learnt I had a lot of issues with it when it came to my self esteem. After imagining my wife with another man I needed her to show me how much she desired me for me to feel comfortable with her again and she's been going above and beyond with that.


Apart from that I can't think of anything else to give an update on. Feel free to ask any questions I'm already a open book but the biggest lesson I've learnt from this whole situation is that complacency and miscommunication are the death of relationships. Never let your significant other feel like they aren't a priority or their needs are falling on deaf ears. It's too easy to blame one person for the demise of a relationship and in some cases that might be true but if you know a person and they do something completely out of character try to examine why. You don't have to forgive them or anything like that, sometimes it is best to walk away. Again, that's for all the support. Also, I didn't reread this so apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes.  ","While I'm glad to hear that you and your wife are making progress in your relationship, I can't help but feel that the focus seems to be mainly on her actions and her healing process. I'm curious, have you considered seeking individual counseling for yourself to work through your emotions and feelings towards the situation? It's important to prioritize your own mental health during this time as well. Additionally, have you and your wife discussed any plans for rebuilding trust and strengthening your communication? It's crucial for both partners to be actively engaged in the healing process.",oppose
"Me (29M) and my ex-girlfriend (28F) were in a relationship for almost 10 years right before she decided to break up with me. We had been together since the 1st year of college and had seen many ups and downs throughout our relationship. Both our families knew that we were together and we were planning on getting married in the month of May, next year (2026). 

Every relationship has its problems and issues and so did ours. The issues mainly were about me not giving her enough time, my parents being too restrictive, her doubting if I'll be able to take a stand for her after we get married and if we will get to travel to various destinations before starting a family. 

Not to dismiss her concerns but we used to talk daily for atleast 1-2 hrs on call even while I was away doing my MBA, even when I was at home before that, we used to meet daily. I had fought with my parents and convinced them that she was the one and I was going to marry her no matter what. One of the reasons I was working hard for my MBA was to provide a good life for us and to fulfill all her wishes. 

The problem started around Jan 2024, when I first heard about a male colleague of hers (Let's call him A). They both had joined the company at the same time. I am not someone who gets jealous of my ex-gf's guy friends (most of her friends are guys) but the way she expressed care about this one was what made me think. He had just got dumped out of a 8 year long relationship himself and was kind of an alcoholic. My ex started mentioning him during our conversations and how she was worried he might do something to harm himself. He used to drink every night and drive home in an inebriated state. She started talking to him during that time to see if he reaches his home safely. 

Me and my ex started getting into fights over her increasing involvement in A's life. She kept telling me that they were just friends and that I was worrying for no reason. Her phone being busy during late nights (our usual calling time) became quite commonplace. She and A would also hangout during the day, going out on lunch etc. It reached a level where I started getting suspicious and forbade her from talking with him multiple times. But each time she would get back to talking with him like it was some drug and she was an addict. I warned her one last time that if this was more than friendship she should let me know. Yet, she kept reassuring me, with all she got, that they were just friends. 

She dumped me this January (2025), saying that she wanted to explore life outside of our relationship and that this was not because she had feelings for someone else. I kept trying to win her back ever since, doing everything I can to meet her, talk to her, stay in touch with her. Meanwhile I had started a new job and had to move to another city in April. My parents had started  making plans for our wedding and wanted to get in touch with her parents. I had not told my parents about the breakup since I was confident that I would win her back eventually (we have had 2-3 so-called breakups during our 10 year relationship and I would always convince her to get back in no time). But this time it was different.

She had asked me not to contact her and we had gone 2 months without talking as she had asked for some space. I was growing worried and anxious because it was something she had never asked for before. Later, she told me to move on and that there was no chance of us getting back together. I eventually gave up and told her that I was going to tell my parents to stop all the wedding plans. I called her to meet up one last time. 

She came to see me in the city where I was located for my job. Her attitude had drastically changed. She was all willing to get back together and everything. It was almost like everything was back to normal. I got further suspicious and decided to check her phone as her actions and words did not align at all. I had never done this before so even I was anxious to do it. 

I checked her phone. All my worst nightmares had come true. My ex and A were seeing each other and it had just started after our breakup. There were all kinds of dirty texts and View Once photos followed by  hearts and kissing and thirsty emojis. I checked her gallery and found that she had been to 5-6 tourist spots with him. It had shirtless videos of him in hotel rooms, where they had stayed together, among other things. 

My heart sank. I wanted to drop dead then and there. I was crying my eyes out. I just couldn't believe that it had happened. I confronted my ex about how she always insisted that A was just a friend and that there was nothing going on between them. She said there's still nothing going on and that there wouldn't ever be anything between them.

I told her that I knew what was going on, and sent her all the evidence that I had found. 

It has been a week now. She has been bombarding my chat with innumerable texts asking for my forgiveness and for a chance to get back together. She calls for hours and cries over the phone, apologizing and begging for me to get back together. To make matters worse, she said that she did what she did because she had feelings for him which was one of the reasons for our breakup. I told her that she should get together with him then. But she keeps on insisting and saying how I'm perfect for her and that she wants noone else, ever. She has stuck around this whole week saying that she wants to work things out with me, no matter what.

I have started feeling bad for what I'm putting her through. I truly believe that, right now, both options (getting back with her and moving on) seem equally bad for me. I am considering if I should get back with her. I know it sounds foolish but ending things with someone after 10 years is truly very difficult and complicated. Both our families are involved and whatever I decide is going to change both of our lives. Would appreciate any advice from you guys. Hope that you keep it civil. 

TL;DR - My ex-girlfriend with whom I was together for 10 years, developed feelings for her male colleague before our breakup and then started seeing him right after she dumped me. She kept lying to me all this time about them being just friends. I confronted my ex after I found out about their affair by checking her phone. She's been begging for my forgiveness ever since and it seems like she genuinely wants to get back together. I need your advice to make this decision of whether or not to take her back. ","It's understandable that you're going through a difficult time right now. I'm not here to judge or take sides, but it's important to consider all the facts before making a decision.

However, it's also important to remember that people make mistakes and can change.

"Long story short I gave my first bj a couple weeks ago and I can’t get it out of my mind. Not only was it nice just cause it was sexual, but it made me realize a lot of things about myself simple bc it was so intimate and it was impossible to not be affected by the nearness. This wasn’t even with someone I really know, just some cute guy for a hookup (with just my mouth).

During it, he put his hand on my back and it was the NICEST feeling.

I’ve gotten hugs from family, had acquaintances rub my back before but none of that has ever felt that good. I can still feel it, and that and the genuinely amazing feeling of intimacy makes me want to cry.

What makes me want to cry isn’t just that it felt so good and I realized what I’ve been missing out on, but the fact that letting someone that close makes them see the worst of me and it’s just not lovable and makes people not feel good so they associate me with bad feelings that they don’t want to be around.

I was so awkward, and the moment made me realize how much I dissociate around others, minimize myself, make myself say stupid things, accidentally say them too. It’s just a mess; a social freak at 28.

I just can’t be normal and idk how.

It’s kind of funny tho that a BLOWJOB made me have this sort of social awareness crises lol. I was always kind of aware of it but when you couple it with this new-found awareness of how badly I want intimacy it’s a mess. 

Edit: and okay lol, it was just SO good to do something like that. When I’m not sad about all the issues that I have that make it hard to even get that close to someone the thought of it feels really good.

Edit again: honestly getting this off my chest did help and I do feel better lol.

"I will preface this by saying my mom (66F) has no ""real"" teeth in her mouth except for 1 or 2, the rest are implants. She has been getting these oral surgeries due to genetic bone loss for about 15 years now.

"Hi everyone I'm new to this sub and I have a question about navigating the workers comp claim following a Long COVID diagnostic.
This new disease doesn't fit in the traditional workers comp boxes and I'm struggling to provide the requested information. For instance, I don't know when or from whom exactly I got COVID. Also, there  is no Long COVID test and I don't know when I'll be cured, if ever.
Do you have any tips on how to navigate this process? I'm a Fed and the DOL has been very dismissive of my situation so far. I am however struggling to focus and feel extremely tired, especially since DOGE took away teleworking. Thank you everyone for your support.","It's understandable that navigating a workers comp claim for Long COVID can be challenging due to the lack of clear cut evidence and definitions. However, it's important to remember that every case is unique and worth pursuing. You might consider gathering as much supporting documentation as possible, such as medical records, witness statements, and proof of employment during the suspected exposure period. Additionally, reaching out to worker's comp advocacy groups or legal professionals could provide valuable insights and guidance. Keep in mind that the process may be lengthy and require patience and persistence. Wishing you all the best in your journey.

"Location: Florida

Yesterday, I met someone to give them a dog I've been trying to rehome. Things went well, and she seemed to like the dog and decided to move forward. She had a friend there that was a bit sketchy. All the info she had of me was an email, and my middle name. We emailed afterwards answering a couple questions: when's his birthday, how much to feed him, etc. Fast forward to today, I checked my email and there was nothing so I assumed she was doing good with the dog. I laid down to take a nap(we have a newborn), and was woken up by my wife saying two women were beating on our door. I was a bit disoriented(you know when you get woken up abruptly), and checked the nest. It was her. I was confused, we met at another location, and she had no info about me. I didn't answer, she told the nest camera she wanted to give the dog back. Then they left.

In the span of about 15 min, they leave messages on both mine and my wife's phones(numbers I didn't give them), and show up my work demanding I take the dog back(I'm on vacation). At this point I'm still confused and a little angry lol. I'm pretty non confrontational and at the same time my brother showed up. Half of me just wanted to call them back and just go get the dog, but the other half of me want nothing to do with people that show up to my job uninvited, much less my home. Before I could think through it, my brother texted and said it he was house sitting and that we were out of town lol, and that it was inappropriate that they showed up to my work. She texted back saying she doesn't want the dog because she's going to lose her apartment if she keeps it.

Is it kind of psycho that they tracked me down, found my job, and then showed up unannounced, or am I being paranoid? I gave them a bunch of dog stuff and dog food. I think one of the boxes had a address label on it and that's how they got it, but I'm not sure. Can I just ignore them, and possible file a incident report if they show up again?","It's understandable that you're feeling confused and uneasy about the situation. However, it's important to remember that everyone's perspective and behavior can vary, and it's possible that she may have had legitimate reasons for wanting to return the dog. It might be helpful to try and communicate with her directly to clarify what happened and why she felt the need to return so suddenly. If you're uncomfortable with her showing up unannounced, you could suggest meeting at a mutually agreed upon location or arranging for someone else to exchange the dog.

"Well, I think I'm not suitable with all the gurus advice out there. Like eat the frog stuff. But I found one thing that weirdly works for me is Dumping all my thoughts into a simple processing system

I started writing down every time I had a thought I didn’t want to lose: “Email X tomorrow” “New idea for Z” “Buy Y before getting home”

First, I just dump all of them into one place with no structure. Just like offloading. With that alone, I feel immediately less foggy. Because I’m not holding 27 thoughts in my head anymore lol

Then, I have a system to organize and turn them into tasks on my calendar automatically. So I can actually turn my thoughts into results

"Just coming here to vent. 9 months sober from meth and today it was randomly heavy on my mind wanting to do it.

"I have tried more than 70 supplements, medications, and lifestyle interventions for long covid. Yes, I previously posted about this. All of the things I've tried have only *kinda* helped a little bit. Well, I decided to try Diamox on sort of a whim (long story, but I did some research and I also found that some people in the ME/CFS community find benefit, and I remembered I had some leftover that I'd taken previously for altitude sickness). And guess what... IT WORKED. I've been taking it for about 2 weeks. I've tried NOT taking it for a day, and the problems start coming back. Here are the symptoms it has affected:

* No more air hunger. I feel like I can breathe again--finally. Before, I felt like I couldn't get enough oxygen and like something with my breathing was... well, off. Now, I still sort of feel like something with my breathing is off, but I don't have that sensation of not getting enough air anymore.
* PEM significantly improved. I went for a 1.15-mile long walk with hills on Saturday morning. This normally would set me back DAYS, and I might not even experience PEM until Monday even. Well, PEM hit me Sunday instead and ONLY lasted through part of Sunday (maybe 3-4 hours), AND I was able to do things during the PEM--I wasn't completely exhausted but could nap on and off in between laundry! Normally, I would've been fine Sunday but then the PEM might hit me Monday and last 'til Wednesday or Thursday with horrible fatigue spells and brain fog throughout those days to the point where it would have been difficult to work.
* Brain fog improved.
* Swollen head feeling improved. Before, I felt like my head was swollen or had a low-key headache all the time. My head feels much lighter on Diamox. 
* Daily fatigue improved. I have been able to work without naps, lying down much less often. 

Things it hasn't improved:

* Depression. This used to be my biggest symptom before the fatigue and PEM hit me around month 2 or 3 after having COVID. It's a tiny bit more manageable to deal with, but I've struggled to find antidepressants that truly work.
* Exercise intolerance. My guess is that this is hard due to deconditioning and that this will improve with the Diamox as well.
* Heart rate issues from sitting to standing. I still feel better lying down, and electrolytes still help my symptoms. I might have POTS, per the long COVID clinic I saw yesterday. I plan to get testing done for this, but I think it's a separate issue. I find it interesting because Diamox is a diuretic and can drain your electrolytes, so you'd think this would potentially make POTS issues worse, but I haven't noticed that (I do track heart rate as well). 

My question for the Reddit community is: Why does this work? A question my long COVID doctor that I saw yesterday had: Are we looking at the wrong things when it comes to long COVID? She was not only shocked by my case in general (due to my having had COVID twice before with no lingering symptoms and my being fully vaccinated--got every booster imaginable) but she was also shocked that Diamox might be helping and wondered if COVID perhaps triggered or reactivated some sort of other illness or if I happened to have developed some sort of secondary infection that caused cerebral edema. She said they don't see cerebral edema with long COVID. 

If anyone has any ideas, I am all ears. I originally posted my theory on this but it’s since been disproven, so I’m back to the drawing board. I really don’t think it’s IIH but it COULD be, I suppose. ","It's interesting to see your experience with Diamox and how it's helping your long COVID symptoms. I've heard of some people finding relief with various treatments, but it's always fascinating to see such a significant improvement. I'm glad you've found something that works for you. However, I'm curious if there might be a placebo effect involved, as your expectations could have played a role in the improvement of your symptoms. It would be interesting to see if the effects persist if you were to stop taking the Diamox for an extended period of time.

"This is a throwaway. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for over 5 years. She has had multiple previous partners. I have a severe case of retroactive jealousy, even though she's the best possible girlfriend I could ask for.

She was my first and only, which is the main cause of my retroactive jealousy. This is not an excuse, I realize it's my flaw and I don't deny it.

Recently, I snooped through her phone (I'm a terrible person, I know) and went through her messages with her ex. 

I found several explicit videos, all of which clearly showed her face. She was only with this partner for a year or two, and over 5 years with me but she always had a strict no recording rule (which is completely fine with me).

On multiple occasions, she made it clear that we would never record each other doing the deed, and that she has never recorded it in the past with anyone else. This was obviously a lie, and I'm heart broken.

I threw up multiple times and don't know what to do. I love her so much but I honestly can't live like this. It's my fault I looked through her phone, and I don't blame her for having past partners. The thing that hurts the most is that she lied straight to my face. Her ex likely still has the videos. 

I want to own up to it and speak to her but I'm a coward. What do I do?","I understand that this situation is difficult for you, and it's important to communicate openly with your girlfriend about your feelings. However, I'd like to suggest considering the possibility that there might be more to the story than what's immediately apparent.

It's possible that her past relationships may have led her to establish certain boundaries, such as not recording intimate moments, to protect her privacy and emotional well-being.

"My friend had bought a Skoda Octavia a couple of years ago. Said it was his dream car. He took a ₹20 lakh loan for it. EMI was around ₹70K a month, way more than what made sense for his salary. He loved that car. Drove it to work, on late night drives, weekend trips, everything. It was his thing.

But over time, it started to sink in. His savings drained. Every month felt like survival. No buffer, no peace of mind. He managed to keep up with payments for about a year and a half. Office salary, bonus, side hustle, everything went into keeping that car.

Yesterday he sold his car and cried. He said this was the worst decision he had ever made and that his dream was short lived. Said if he had planned better, maybe he could have owned it properly one day. He used the money to clear the loan. Told me he had no savings but at least now he would have some cash to get through the month. And that he finally realised no one is coming, there’s no miracle that gives you money to fix things.

The car drained him so much that even his credit card debt piled up, that’ll take another 5 months to clear.

"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.
","I appreciate your dedication to the care of elderly individuals and the insights you've shared. However, I'd like to add a different perspective. While it's important to ensure safety and preparedness, it's equally crucial to maintain dignity and respect for those under our care. Overly restrictive measures, like locking doors or installing window guards, may inadvertently create an environment of mistrust and discomfort.

Perhaps focusing on alternative methods, like engaging in activities that promote independence and autonomy, would be more beneficial for both the caregiver and the care recipient. For instance, setting up reminders, creating a routine, or using technology like smart locks that can be easily managed could",oppose

He asked me so many questions and kind of asked me if I wanted to hang out soon and he wanted to meet my dog.

When her replies slowed down, I thought to myself, 'I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE!', it's happened 1 million times before, at that point i may as well take drastic measures to meet, cos the ships sinking. Not realising, my inability to handle that panic, and just **let it pass**, was probably the VERY thing that she picked up as weird.

I thought that BECAUSE she lost interest, that's why I felt fear. If I just had awareness I'd have realised that the **fear came first**, and that **influenced** my explanation, and therefore my action. 

Which brings me to, wtf do i do about this? **Awareness.**

All you have to do, to overcome this is be aware that panic sits inside you. Nothing else, no breathing, no course, no gym. Just be aware and you'll be more free to move forward, without the chains of your past.

Note: This applies to all situations, absolutely can happen with friends, family members, work colleagues etc.","It's understandable that you felt fear and panic when her replies slowed down, but perhaps she was just busy or preoccupied. Maybe giving her some space and not pushing for a meet-up right away could have been a better approach. It's important to remember that everyone has their own pace and rhythm when it comes to communication. It's not always about us and our needs. Sometimes, being patient and respectful can go a long way.",oppose
"On an airport bus, I was taking a second to put my bag on a luggage rack, as my husband was making his way to the window seat so I can sit on the aisle seat beside him. I suddenly felt a nudge and a push - and I turned to see a woman push past me to another empty pair of seats. I said, hey no need to push, I was done anyway. And by now I am in fact completely out of the way. She says I have to be first, I am in a hurry. I said we're all going to the same place - the plane! Please use your words and not your hands to make way. She scoffs and says yeah yeah go back to the land you came from. I said this is my land, and I am a Dutch citizen. She said congratulations with sarcasm. Then I stayed quiet,

These words 'go back...'  stung soooo much, like irrational level. Maybe because it made me feel less than, in the tone that she used. Maybe it made me feel that she thinks she is justified in pushing me because I'm not the same skin color as her. 

Anyway the irony is she wasn't even Dutch (could see her passport a little in her hand, and it wasn't Dutch). But she just assumed that because she is white and I am brown she can say these words and they will hold meaning.

I just wanted to vent this out somewhere because it's a rather small incident, but because it's the only I've been involved in, I felt bad about it.","It's unfortunate that people still behave that way towards each other. I hope you were able to find a seat and enjoy the rest of your journey.

"I (29M) turned 29 yesterday. No calls. No texts. Not even a Facebook notification. I knew I probably wouldn’t hear from anyone, my family and I are estranged, I lost touch with friends during the pandemic, and my job is remote. I didn’t expect much.

But still… it stung.

So I walked to the bakery and bought a small cake. Chocolate with blue icing. I asked them to write “Happy Birthday, James!” on it. When they asked if it was for a kid or an adult, I smiled and lied, said, “Oh, it’s for my little cousin.”

I brought it home, lit a candle, and sang the song quietly to myself. I took a picture of it, posted it to my private Instagram like someone else had bought it for me. Just so it wouldn’t look so lonely.

It’s dumb, I know. But I needed it to feel like someone remembered me.

I didn’t even eat much of the cake. I just sat there and thought about how life kind of drifts when no one’s around to anchor it.

Anyway. Happy birthday to me, I guess.","I understand how you're feeling, it can be tough when we don't receive the recognition we expect on our birthday.

"I’ve struggled most of my life (grew up in a traumatic environment with difficult parents, instability, bullying due to being a minority and financial struggles). But this year I finally feel I’m in a better place. I never thought I would reach this point in my life, I feel like I need to pinch myself. I don’t have much to complain about, despite everything happening in the world. I started being able to sleep whole nights for the first time ever this year (medications helped), started to eat more balanced, and make myself exercise without judging myself or struggling with it. I am in good health after years of dealing with a recurring chronic illness. I turned my job around from almost being fired a year ago to now finding a niche that I’m good at. I am now able to apply everything I learnt in therapy like noticing the love I have in my life and being able to navigate my anxiety better. My partner and I are working better at our relationship. I still have my ups and downs but overall life is going great. I want to give myself credit for getting to this point, because it took a lot of small incremental changes over the years and a lot of mental work and support I built around me and within myself to get here. Except it feels like a switch flipped overnight this year and everything started to fall into place. It feels a bit unbelievable because this is the life I always used to crave and think it would never be possible for someone with my background.

"throwaway account because lowkey paranoid lmao

I'm at an employee at this advertisement and marketing company. TLDR; we make infographics and commercials for clients.

We make original stuff. At the very least used to. Company had big shot clients.

And then the boss started turning to AI to ""streamline"" efforts.

It started out small; AI on the backgrounds. AI to make character designs. I don't agree with it. I hate it. But whatever; I'm just here to work.

And then; he wanted to train us to start learning how to prompt.

And then it just entirely became ""let's have the AI make the entire video for us.""

Haven't had good clients in a while. Pretty sure its because this company is getting blacklisted left and right from the ""content"" it churns out. Imagine being an artist forced to prompt? Wrestling with the LLM when I could easily just draw this.

But no. ""It's too slow to draw. We can prompt this in 20 minutes.""

It's just bad. Like. Genuine bad bad.  I'm not even going to talk about the ethical stuff. Aesthetically wise, its just bad.

It's inconsistent. There is that shit yellow tint everywhere; and the logistical nightmare that'll happen when client inevitably will ask for revisions.

I'm tired.

We used to make really nice work too.

I mean. I'm not fired. AI didn't replace my work.

"It happened.

I had met the girl of my dreams.

So I had thought.

We met at a military ball, she thought I was cute and gave me her number, and we started dating shortly after. We went a few months together, and we were already sure we were each other's person. We were planning on marriage (not at that moment but eventually), she said she saw me as someone she wanted to spend her life with. To have kids with. To grow old together. We lost our virginity to each other even.

The relationship was good overall, we were there for each other, there were some bumps, but I made sure to communicate. She had issues being expressive or giving effort into the relationship at times due to past trauma. It was one sided emotionally and effort-wise, with me giving most/all the effort. That did hurt me, and we did have conversations where she expressed that I deserved better. Still though, it was something I was willing to work with her on, and she was showing signs of improvement. That was really all ""wrong"" with our relationship. That and my mom didn't approve of her, something that hurt my ex very much. But still.

We were both planning on doing the military together. I had already enlisted, she was going to enlist next year, and we would be co located eventually after marrying. We were confident we could handle the struggle of a military relationship. She stressed she wouldn't quit, that I was worth it, that we could do it. I believed her.

A week or two ago, my gut told me she was getting ready to break up. I always get a vibe, and it's NEVER been wrong. I expressed this concern to her, and I made sure she still wanted me in her future. She assured me. I still felt though things were off.

Last night, we said goodnight. She said she'd talk to me tomorrow, that she misses me, and that she loves me. Then an hour after that (when she supposedly went to sleep), she sent me the text. Here it is:

""So, this sucks because I really hate that I’m doing this to you, but I also admit I’m a coward who doesn’t have the balls to say this shit to your face. Uhh, I’m going to end things for us, I think that this is better for us because there’s just a lot of collision in our relationship that isn’t working for me. You’ve been wonderful, amazing, kind, like don’t get me wrong you’re literally perfect. And I don’t mean to do the cliche ‘it’s not you it’s me’ thing but it literally is. I can’t communicate, I can’t provide, I’m not good for you. I’m a really terrible person and I need to fix that, you deserve more than I was able to offer. Honestly part of me wants you to hate me, blame me, do whatever you can to cope. Uhm, I’m blocking you on everything because I really don’t want you to try and call or text saying we can fix things or whatever. Like my mind is pretty well set on this, it just better this way. I want the best for you, I hope you achieve all your dreams and goals. As much as it doesn’t seem like it, I really do love you. Bye \[my name\].

Then of course, I was blocked on everything. Just out of the blue. Just like that. All that talk. I'll be there for you. I'm not going to quit. You're worth it. Everything down the drain. I had planned my life with this girl, she wanted me to propose this month. The last time we had seen eachother, maybe a few days ago, we had a nice little date that she planned. We hugged and kissed. We talked and laughed. There was no warning besides my gut.

I immediately reached out to her family. Her family loves me, they consider her apart of the family. They expressed their condolences; they're shocked as much as I am. They think that she's in the wrong. They support me.

All I want is to see her and talk to her face to face and resolve this. If things work out, and we're able to fix it, great. If not, I need closure. I need this last face to face to move on. I expressed this to her family and they advised me to give her space for like a week and hope she reached out, and that they would try talking to her in the meantime.

It's the day after the message and I'm still trying to figure this out. I'm in a state of shock. Everything down the drain. For what? Part of me wants to hate her for doing such a scummy move, but I still love her. I want to talk to her. I'm currently giving her space, and waiting as her family helps me through this.

Plot twist though. I had talked to her sisters, and they actually told me that she's been talking to her exes. They broke into her computer and told me they found her flirting with her exes, planning hangouts, venting about our relationship being ""toxic"" and ""drama filled,"" even having her exes send her money. And I knew about none of this. Apparently she texted an ex the moment she dumped me. Her sisters are disgusted, they also loved me, they're assuring me that I dodged a bullet.

I talked to her mom about that, and she said she's not defending my ex, but that there's a good chance it's not true - apparently her sisters like to stir drama. So we'll see I guess. That's something to consider.

Honestly, I'm putting the military on hold now. My ex is what pushed me to go that route anyways, and I turn 18 in less than a month (which be the way we're both 17) so I want time to enjoy life freely. I want to put myself back together before full sending it.

I'm still in a state of shock. I'm numb and have been crying off and on the whole time. I'm just so confused. If she loves me, and I love her, what reason is there to break up? Maybe it's a self esteem issue with the ""you deserve better""? I have no idea. Then there's the whole potential cheating thing.

At the end of the day, all I want is that face to face. I don't intend for her to get away with text breakup, that is not okay. I feel like a shell of what I was. I feel terribly lonely. It hurts extra because I have trauma myself and had insecurities and fears the whole time, she reassured me on those and RIGHT at the moment I fully believed her, that I fully got over my trust issues and trusted her with my life, did she do this.","It's unfortunate that things didn't work out as you had hoped. However, it's important to remember that everyone goes through heartbreak at some point in their lives. It might be helpful to focus on self-care and healing during this time. It's also essential to consider that people change and grow, and relationships can evolve in unexpected ways. While it's natural to feel hurt and confused, try to keep an open mind about the situation. It might not be possible to understand her reasons for ending things right now, but perhaps there will be clarity in time. In the meantime, take care of yourself and seek support from friends and family.",oppose

"I tracked almost everything while being on this journey I spent more than 627h hours since february on improving my life thats around 4hours per day, and that’s just the active doing stuff. All the passive mental work, reflections, mindset changes wasn’t even tracked.

For the last few years my life was pretty messed up, after some hard past years I spiraled more and more into depression… I slept till afternoon, ate junk, smoked weed and gamed all day.  

That lifestyle just made me even more depressed, I saw my friends succeeding, getting jobs, girlfriends, moving to new locations… just being happy. That honestly made me even more sad, so I decided at the beginning of the year to turn my life around, because I thought I either I´ll continue with this shitty lifestyle and eventually die feeling like I haven´t done anything with my life or trying to get out of this shit and finally make my life worthwhile. 

I convinced a friend of mine to join the journey because he was like me, depressed, hopeless, smoking weed all day and just miserable. 

The first thing we did was starting to go outside more, running or doing some small workouts, sweating made me feel so much better, it was like I sweated all the toxins and bad energy out of my body. My buddy and I got a gym membership together and started going 5x to the gym every week. 

The negative was that we still smoked weed pretty heavily in the evenings and after the gym, so 2 months ago we decided to also quit that shit as the next step, and what can I say. The last 2 months have been one of the best months, I finally sleep waay better with the new energy my workouts feel even better, I´m more awake and honestly way more confident due to the achievements I made the last few months. 

Together we started looking for jobs and after 4 years of unemployment, I got a job at a garden center, which is pretty funny considering my old ""hobby"" was growing weed lol. My buddy got a job in logistics, and I even started to get in contact again with an old love I had when I was younger. 

If you're where I was, just start with one thing. Go for a walk with a buddy or alone. Just move your body. You got this.

Any insight into this would be welcome thanks.","It's important to remember that disclosing mental health conditions is a personal decision and everyone's experience with employers can vary. While it's great that this employer is offering support, it's also important to consider the potential risks of disclosing sensitive information. Some employers may view mental health conditions as a liability and could potentially use it against you, even if unintentionally. It's essential to weigh the benefits and potential risks before making a decision.

"After 3 yrs of dating and trying to find a partner, I finally met someone who's got most of the internal qualities anyone would want in partner. Kind, empathetic, mature, emotionally aware and the biggest one - calms my nervous system. 

However, he lives in another city, with no solid plan to move near me (my city has more job opportunities and he's been trying to change his job but the economy is horrible). I wasn’t initially considering him as a serious match due to the distance. Ended up meeting him 3 times when he was here, and found it hard to be attracted to him, if I'm being really specific, it was his body type (I hate pointing this one out). I was taken aback since his photos on the profile were old where he was much fit and younger? Every conversation I have over video calls makes me drawn to his personality but I vowed to myself that I will not entertain long distance due to my past ldr relationships. 

Now that I truly like being single, I value quality relationships. Even if I wait and let the attraction grow, I don't foresee it being possible over video calls. Appreciate any thoughts

TLDR: everything seems good emotionally with this guy but not sure if I should continue if the relationship will require us being long distance. 


Edit: Thank you all! Extremely grateful to get a response.","It's understandable that you're facing a difficult decision. Long distance relationships can be challenging, especially when it comes to physical attraction. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. Have you considered the possibility that the in-person meetings may have influenced your perception of his body type? And regarding the job situation, perhaps you could explore the possibility of relocating to his city? It might open up new opportunities for both of you.

"I graduated in my degree last year and I have a fully written paper ML as a final in my class that my professor suggested publishing because he was impressed. I held off because I was working full time and taking 2 courses at a time, so I didn't feel like I had time. When i finished and officially conferred, i was told that the school has new restrictions on being an alumni and publishing the paper that would restrict me from doing so, even though I have my professor's name on it and he did help me on this. He said it just needs tweaks to fit in conferences(when we had first discussions after the course completed). So, I've ignored publishing until now.

"Hey all. I wrote recently my psych tried to swap me to Mydayis (generic) from Adderall. Insurance won't approve it until I fail 3 meds, so he decided on Vyvanse instead. 

I am currently on Adderall 20mg XR and a 10mg IR booster. I split the booster and make this 3 doses to last the day. It felt, ok, but not therapeutic enough. The XR only lasts 5 hrs (thus psych suggesting a change).

So, I start 30mg Vyvanse tomorrow with a 10mg Adderall IR booster (all generic).

I am nervous! I've read great and not so great things on here for Vyvanse. I'm scared it will be either way too weak, or maybe I will have bad side effects and be stuck with it for a month (I mean can you even swap meds mid month with the fda rules, I assume not). I'm worried it won't outperform the Adderall XR regarding 5 hrs of help. I am also hopeful it will and it'll be perfect.

(Not asking advice on this, just sharing my worries).

I guess since I have never swapped medication, my main question is if you have any advice when switching med types or maybe words of encouragement. ","While I understand your concerns about switching to Vyvanse, I think it's important to remember that everyone's response to medication can vary greatly. What works for one person might not work for another. Your psych's suggestion to try Vyvanse is based on your specific situation and symptoms, and it's possible that you may find it more effective than Adderall.

It's also worth noting that the length of effectiveness for a medication can depend on various factors, including individual metabolism and dosage.

"So I was rear ended in Feb of 2024, my lawyer called today and said he was able to settle and I will be receiving about 20k in pain and suffering damages. Because of the accident we had to take out a loan for a car and bought a 2024 Toyota Corolla. At the time the loan was 27k 640/month. We aggressively paid down the loan over the last year and half so now it's 13k. We refinanced and got a lower interest rate and payment is now 315/month.

"I have tried more than 70 supplements, medications, and lifestyle interventions for long covid. Yes, I previously posted about this. All of the things I've tried have only *kinda* helped a little bit. Well, I decided to try Diamox on sort of a whim (long story, but I did some research and I also found that some people in the ME/CFS community find benefit, and I remembered I had some leftover that I'd taken previously for altitude sickness). And guess what... IT WORKED. I've been taking it for about 2 weeks. I've tried NOT taking it for a day, and the problems start coming back. Here are the symptoms it has affected:

* No more air hunger. I feel like I can breathe again--finally. Before, I felt like I couldn't get enough oxygen and like something with my breathing was... well, off. Now, I still sort of feel like something with my breathing is off, but I don't have that sensation of not getting enough air anymore.
* PEM significantly improved. I went for a 1.15-mile long walk with hills on Saturday morning. This normally would set me back DAYS, and I might not even experience PEM until Monday even. Well, PEM hit me Sunday instead and ONLY lasted through part of Sunday (maybe 3-4 hours), AND I was able to do things during the PEM--I wasn't completely exhausted but could nap on and off in between laundry! Normally, I would've been fine Sunday but then the PEM might hit me Monday and last 'til Wednesday or Thursday with horrible fatigue spells and brain fog throughout those days to the point where it would have been difficult to work.
* Brain fog improved.
* Swollen head feeling improved. Before, I felt like my head was swollen or had a low-key headache all the time. My head feels much lighter on Diamox. 
* Daily fatigue improved. I have been able to work without naps, lying down much less often. 

Things it hasn't improved:

* Depression. This used to be my biggest symptom before the fatigue and PEM hit me around month 2 or 3 after having COVID. It's a tiny bit more manageable to deal with, but I've struggled to find antidepressants that truly work.
* Exercise intolerance. My guess is that this is hard due to deconditioning and that this will improve with the Diamox as well.
* Heart rate issues from sitting to standing. I still feel better lying down, and electrolytes still help my symptoms. I might have POTS, per the long COVID clinic I saw yesterday. I plan to get testing done for this, but I think it's a separate issue. I find it interesting because Diamox is a diuretic and can drain your electrolytes, so you'd think this would potentially make POTS issues worse, but I haven't noticed that (I do track heart rate as well). 

My question for the Reddit community is: Why does this work? A question my long COVID doctor that I saw yesterday had: Are we looking at the wrong things when it comes to long COVID? She was not only shocked by my case in general (due to my having had COVID twice before with no lingering symptoms and my being fully vaccinated--got every booster imaginable) but she was also shocked that Diamox might be helping and wondered if COVID perhaps triggered or reactivated some sort of other illness or if I happened to have developed some sort of secondary infection that caused cerebral edema. She said they don't see cerebral edema with long COVID. 

If anyone has any ideas, I am all ears. I originally posted my theory on this but it’s since been disproven, so I’m back to the drawing board. I really don’t think it’s IIH but it COULD be, I suppose. ","It's interesting to hear about your experience with Diamox and how it's helped alleviate some of your long COVID symptoms. However, I'm curious if there could be a placebo effect at play here, as you mentioned that you've tried over 70 supplements and medications before with only slight improvements. It's not unheard of for people to feel better after starting a new treatment, even if it's not directly related to the condition they're trying to manage. I hope that your progress continues and that you're able to get some answers about why this medication is working for you.

"i'll start by saying i know that i'm young, and i'm not particularly interested in talking about that, i don't want to get into arguments about being ""too young for this"" or embarrass myself by saying i'm ""mature for my age"" because i do handle myself well, but i'm still young and dumb, so i'd rather leave that fact where it is. it is, though, worth mentioning that this guy is my first boyfriend. i've gotten close to dating before but i never found anyone that met my standards (incredibly high in spite of a shitty dad who set the bar in hell). i trust him more than anything. i've trusted him with my first date, my first kiss, my first everything except for sex, i plan to wait on that for personal reasons entirely aside from him. he's literally the first guy to ever hold my hand, as far as i can remember. he's always gone so above and beyond to make sure i feel safe and comfortable whenever we do anything.

i'm autistic, in the way that you couldn't really tell if you didn't know anything about it because i spent 17 years masking without realizing it, but if you squint you can definitely tell. and with that, i'm incredibly direct (part of the reason it also took me 17 years to date). at the start of our relationship, i made my needs clear (emotionally, for the most part, but they kind of bled into sexual territory when it comes to needing to feel safe and taken care of lol) and i wanted to make sure our needs aligned or else i wouldn't want to waste my time on a relationship that wouldn't work. so we talked, which lead to preferences, which led to us dating now and being unbelievably in love in the way that young people always get in movies, and it's awesome and scary and i am obsessed with every second.

the only thing that concerns me is that, in some conversations we've had (i.e., woke up hard because i had a dream about you, let me tell you about it) i've noticed some things that kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

he's been very open with me about past trauma, which i'm very thankful for because i know it's been so scary and that trust is not something he takes lightly, but because of that, it set off... something, in my brain, when he told me he had a dream that i was older than him. (irl i'm a few months younger, whatever who cares.) but when i asked how much older, it was like. 13 years. and i get that some people like cougars, but i know that he was groomed in his younger teen years by a woman in her early 30's. so i told him i didn't feel great about it, and why, and he said i was right and left it.

i thought maybe it was a coping thing and that was it, but he told me he kinda gets off on the idea of me obsessing over him. like, stalker obsession. i told him i was hesitant to indulge the idea because it's every woman's worst nightmare and just a few months ago i had a then-friend who bordered on harassment, and to this day i'm still thankful that i work inside of a gated community. he said he understood, proverbially dusted off his hands like it was nothing, and dropped it immediately. but today during a conversation, i realized that this was another thing. he's had a girl before show up at his work multiple times asking for him, been harassed by someone a few grades down from him from when we were in highschool, and one of his coworkers has directly harassed him and even gone as far to grab him and slap his ass even though SHE has a girlfriend and she KNOWS he has one too. she also kept pressuring him into doing drugs with her and her girlfriend, knowing he's just over a year completely clean, so yeah i'm a BIG fan of her. i hope the earth swallows her whole after he leaves his job next month. when he finally told her off she said she thought he was ""playing hard to get"" but it didn't freak him out any less. i couldn't help but realize that he was getting close to what he had fantasized, i guess, about, just not with me, and he hated it. he was even apologetic and frantic explaining what happened, promising that he didn't want it and that he was so so sorry (he's been made to feel like he ""obviously wanted it"" in past situations, highschool was a total shit show) and i made sure he knew that i know he didn't. i know he hates it, and he has every right to. it's a terrible situation when it's actually happening. he even told me he was nervous leaving work in case she was waiting outside when he clocked out, which i understand. she'd started acting hostile to him during shift, yelling orders at him instead of just punching in tickets. she's apparently incredibly tall and muscular and like 22, maybe? so i get it. to be also fair, he's 5'10, does like 6 sets on the bench with my body weight, and he's a black belt. he's, in the past, put someone in the icu. it's far from my favorite fun fact about him, but it serves to the point: i don't feel the need to worry about him. that, though, doesn't make the fear anyess real.

it just made me recognize a pattern of sexualizing traumatic memories, and not in the ""absent father so i have a daddy kink"" kind of way (me fr we don't need to get into that though.) it's more like, he takes the exact situation he was in and puts it through this sexy, romanticized lense, and i don't feel comfortable indulging it, but i don't know if i should directly discourage it? i feel like i should. it doesn't seem healthy and i don't know where it really comes from. is it maybe a control thing? taking a terrible thing that happened to him and imagining it to be something he can say he liked so it's not as hard to think about? idk. psychoanalysis of my lover aside, they're also just not things i'm really into lol

i like the silly things like randomly taking up a southern accent to give him a boner and laugh at him (lovingly, of course, he thinks it's funny too LMAO), or making out in my backseat listening to goth music talking about if we were vampires, what era would we be from? don't get me wrong, i was exposed to a lot of shit from a way too young age. just because i don't have the first hand experience doesn't mean i'm sexually blinded. immature? sure, probably. unaware? absolutely not. 

i'll also not lie and say i don't get a kick listening to him call me ""sweet girl"" while he bites my thighs, or the way his eyes roll back because i offhandedly compare him to a guard dog. i'll try plenty of things, especially for him, but the romanticizing of extremely traumatic things, and then going to associate them with ME, feels so far from something i even know how to deal with. i guess i have a good start saying i'm uncomfortable, and he's incredibly reciprocal about it and has never brought it up after the first time, until i mentioned the pattern, but i just. idk. i feel like there's something more to say, i just don't know what to say. i feel just a little weird knowing that's rolling around in his brain.

edit: the main suggestion seems to be therapy, so i'll say now that it's not really possible at the moment. his parents don't believe in it (only one of the ever growing number of issues i have with them) so they won't pay for it. they don't see it as a necessity and they already make him feel like he's ""hemorrhaging"" them money because they pay for his insulin and business degree, both equal essentials in their eyes. he can't pay for counseling himself, because he's in that broke college student part of life where he's about to leave his highschool job and he has no promise of one on campus, just applications on the desk of about every hiring manager that place has. i looked into the school's counseling services, and it seems to be just free 20 minute drop-in sessions to vent about your academic stress between classes, so that's something i guess, not really the kind of thing you need to pick apart your sexual psychology.","I understand where you're coming from, but it's important to remember that everyone processes trauma differently and what might be concerning for you might not be for him. It's not my place to judge his coping mechanisms. However, I do think it's worth having an open conversation about these feelings and how they impact your relationship.

"I, '26F' want to break up with my boyfriend, '27M'  after almost 2 years..

I don't know how to break up with my partner as I still care for him but I know I deserve better. 

A little backstory, we met on Tinder in November 2023 and moved into together very quickly (2-3 months), everything was fine until maybe 6 months in where we stopped being intimate and after weeks of pushing he told me he didn't find me attractive anymore. This was the night before my aunties funeral which sucked even more.

We worked through that then a few months later he tells me he is going on a one month work trip, missing our 1 year anniversary. I was upset but got over it. Then a few weeks before he leaves he says he wants to take his family dogs in as his mother is wanting to give them away. We decide then to move house however we struggle to find something before he leaves so I am stuck moving everything into a storage unit and moving back in with my parents while his mother holds onto the dogs a bit longer. 

Maybe a week and a half into his trip, my grandfather has a heart attack and ends up in the ICU for two weeks. I call him to tell him he may have to leave his trip early as he is most likely going to die. Me and my grandfather were super close so I was really struggling and he knew this. He tells me he can't leave early, not really giving me an answer about why. Just an insight I know he wasn't cheating as I know it seems sus but we would video chat while he was away and knew some of his work mates so I knew where he was and what he was doing most of the time. 

My grandfather eventually passes away and I am devastated. I am constantly crying and won't eat, but what sucked the most was I had no support. I had to take over planning some of the funeral to help my grandmother and aunt. The funeral was terrible as I had no one to help me through it. 

After all of that, I end up finding us a house to live in which was great so I then move most of our stuff into this house alone. The last week of the trip he calls me and tells me after this work trip he is quitting as he is not performing well  and if he doesn't they are most likely going to fire him anyway. (he works in a sales role and is only casual)

I was so angry that I did all of this, struggled so much while he was gone just for him to quit. But I said nothing and supported him anyway. I went back to full time work as I was only part time before this and supported us. 

January 2025, 1 week before my birthday I found out he cheated on me during that period where he did not find me attractive. From what I could see it was just texting a girl who lives in another state where nudes were sent but there was plans to meet up when she came to Sydney so I don't know if they actually did or didn't. I confronted him about it and he admitted to it straight away. He said he understood if I left him but I felt cornered as we had just signed this new lease and he had no where to go so I decided to stay. 

It's now July 2025 and he still has no job, no money and I pay for everything (rent, bills etc) I can't keep doing this. We had a discussion about 3 months ago where he said he wanted to move out as he feels like he has had no time to be alone in a few years. I took it rough but eventually agreed and decided since he has the dogs I will move back to my parents when he is a bit more stable. He has made no serious moves to fix anything so I've decided to just throw him into the deep end and am moving back home over the next few weeks. 

I want to break up with him once I have moved out but am struggling as I still care for him and it has been so long since everything happened I feel I have no right to be upset anymore. I should have moved on and I feel terrible but I just can't be in this relationship anymore. I feel like I put 100% into this relationship and it's killing me but I don't know how to do it.

Maybe you could suggest finding a stylish and discreet medical alert that she would be more comfortable wearing. There are many options available nowadays that blend in with fashion accessories, such as pendant necklaces or bracelets. It might be worth exploring these alternatives together.",oppose
"Lately I’ve been noticing how easy it is to lose time, hours of scrolling, endless notifications, always looking outward instead of inward. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve come to deeply value what truly brings me peace. 

This summer I started doing things I never made time for before. Walking barefoot in the grass. Making watercolour art outside. Dancing with my little cousins under summer sky. If you’re feeling burnt out, overstimulated or just numb, I highly recommend this. Step outside. Let summer remind you what it means to live in your body. Not everything worthy of your attention is behind a screen. 

Choose presence over passive consumption. Replace dopamine hits with real joy. Experience what it feels like to be curious, creative, connected without a screen.

This is what I did this summer. I visited new parks. Had a phone free picnic in our own yard with homemade food. My brother and I went to the splash pad like kids again and laughed until we couldn’t breathe. I floated on my back in a pool and let the sun touch my skin. Painted with ice chalk in the morning before my brain filled with notifications. Walked to get ice cream without headphones, just soft conversation. Helped my little cousins wash their play dishes with grass, water and giggles. We ran through sprinklers barefoot. Washed the car with Papa after a thunderstorm. We planted corn and measured how it grew.

We built a fort with leftover cloth and sticks. I tried geocaching (yes it still exists) and felt the thrill of hidden treasures. We jumped in puddles after rain. Built a backyard obstacle course with ropes, chairs and chalk. Created sidewalk masterpieces. Played follow the leader until we were dizzy. Watched a baseball game, no phones. Did scavenger hunts for feathers, odd rocks, yellow things. Identified trees. Picked sun warm peaches at an orchard. Built a drive in movie setup with bedsheets. Drew chalk roads and sent toy cars on adventures.

I danced in the rain. Bird watched early in the morning with binoculars. Went to a fair. Made water silhouettes on hot pavement. Caught fireflies in jars with holes punched in the lid. Flew a kite in the golden hour. Played tag with neighbourhood kids. Roasted s’mores. Ate dinner outside by candlelight. Made collages with flowers and leaves. Rode bikes slowly through quiet streets. Found feathers, smooth stones, heart shaped clouds.

I read outside. Watched clouds move. Painted on the porch. Invited friends for a no hands ice cream sundae party. Rolled down grassy hills. Camped in the backyard. Went on a boat ride at dusk. Built and painted a bird feeder. Had a wild outdoor dance party. Built a sandcastle with my neighbour’s daughter. Tie dyed old t-shirts. Made a time capsule. Did leaf rubbings. Went on an ABC scavenger hunt (A for ant, B for bark, C for cloud). Hula hooped like fools. Made pinecone bird feeders. Went camping. Played barefoot soccer. Jumped rope. Jumped again because it made me feel like me.

Went fishing with my uncle. Planted a garden with Mama. Lit sparklers, it felt like Diwali. Let the kids run wild while we watched them. Washed bikes. Painted flowerpots. Took hammock naps. Played cornhole. Sold lemonade. Did yoga on bare earth, no mat.

We turned delivery boxes into forts, cars, houses. Watched butterflies flit. Blew bubbles. Hosted a progressive brunch with neighbours, each house served a dish. Played bocce ball. Pretended to be pirates. Observed bugs with magnifying glasses. Played hide and seek. Had a 2000s music BBQ. Played ladder ball. Made garden markers with stones. Had a literal pie throwing contest. Watched another baseball game. Took a bird counting walk with my Aaju. Had a messy water balloon fight. Went horseback riding. Drew racetracks. Built DIY mini golf. Did a puppet show. Built a giant Jenga tower. Had a watermelon seed spitting contest. Watched the sunset in silence. Played tennis. Visited the farmer’s market. Weeded the garden I planted. Took care of it. Took care of me. Made a birdbath. Watched them come.

I did all of this instead of disappearing into a screen. Because I wanted my life back. This isn’t about being perfect. I still use tech. But now, it doesn’t use me.

And if you’re feeling wired, numb, lost I promise the cure isn’t online. It’s under the sky. Go outside. Do something real. Touch the grass. Feel the dirt. Hear yourself laugh again.

","I appreciate your dedication to finding joy outside this summer. However, I have to admit that I've been enjoying my air-conditioned indoor activities during these hot temperatures.

"When I initially got prescribed Vyvanse my psychiatrist told me to eat something before I take it. Here’s my issue: I am autistic and I really hate breakfast because it tends to overstimulating for me to eat in the morning, and I have to fight myself just to eat half a granola bar or a couple crackers before I take my Vyvanse.

I know I know, “just listen to your psychiatrist”. but I’m genuinely curious if eating before taking Vyvanse is REALLY a necessity, especially when it’s a hard morning and I don’t want to cause myself to meltdown because I had to eat in the morning…","I understand where you're coming from, and I'm not here to dispute the validity of your personal experiences.

I totally get it. Two doctors, four meds, one is twice a day, the others are once a day. They’re refilled at different times. It’s confusing to begin with and then you add a brain disorder on top of it.

"This is pretty fucked up, but my brother died two years ago. Shortly after his death, his dad (different dads) was able to sign into his iCloud account with the goal of finding pictures of him for his funeral and memorial posts. While I was in the depths of grief having just lost my older brother, his dad called me one afternoon pleading with me to go through his photo gallery so he and my brother’s grandmother could search his photo gallery for pictures/memories/etc.

Initially I refused (for obvious reasons). My brother’s dad told me he understood and that he would figure it out. Couple days later, I got a call from my brother’s grandmother who was crying because she couldn’t go through his pictures (mind you, all of this happened within a week of his death so emotions everywhere were through the roof).

I felt bad for her, and I felt bad for his dad and everyone else that wanted these pictures off his phone but didn’t want to potentially see any inappropriate pictures of him. I finally gave in and logged into his iCloud account and scoured his 1000+ picture gallery for anything he wouldn’t want his family seeing.

It was a lot. Both in the number of pictures and the mental strain this whole experience had on me - but I did it and his family was able to get the pictures they wanted.

I’ve always felt weird about doing that. I hate that doing that was the last thing I ever did for my brother. While I’m sure he’s happy somewhere knowing his dad and grandmother didn’t have to see that, I hate that I had to be the one that did.

I’ll never understand why they would ask me to do that. It doesn’t feel right and it honestly makes me sick to my stomach.","I'm really sorry for your loss and I can understand the complex emotions you're dealing with. However, I'd like to bring up a different perspective. While it's understandable that your brother's family wanted access to his iCloud account, it's also important to consider the potential violation of privacy. Even in death, people have the right to keep certain things private. It might be worth considering the legal and ethical implications of granting access to someone else's digital accounts after they pass away.",oppose
"A week ago, my father died by suicide, and it's turned my world upside down. He was my rock and the person I loved most in the world.

For some back story, my parents had a toxic relationship my whole life, they were married for a few months and divorced a month before I was born, constantly in custody battles, and often used me to hurt each other. I was exposed to a lot of mental manipulation from both sides, but especially from my mom.

Since my dad’s passing, my mom says I can talk to her about how I'm feeling, but when I do, she reacts in really uncomfortable ways. She’ll say things like, ""You still have your mom,"" or ""I'm not dead yet,"" or she’ll roll her eyes and avoid sitting with me when I ask to talk. If I don’t talk, she gets upset. If I do talk, she gets offended. It's like I'm walking on eggshells no matter what.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

How do I protect my emotional space while still living with her? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of complicated parent relationship while grieving? I am so grateful for any advice.

"I tend to have a really hard time deciding what to eat especially when it’s for multiple people. 

I am a picky eater so my palette isn’t like that wide but I do like a decent amount of things.

I thought for a while trying to think of something but I kept coming up blank. So I just told her I’d be fine with anything that I already like ( she knows what those things are for the most part ) she seemed to have an attitude with me because of my answer and said she’d have to figure something out before hanging up. 

When I’m at home I don’t have this issue we all eat what it is we what instead of all eating the same thing. It’s different here. 

Now I’m stuck in what to do. I’d really hate for her to pick something and then it turns out to be something I don’t like. 

What should I do? ","I understand your predicament. However, instead of relying on someone else to make the decision, why not try expanding your palate a bit and suggest a new dish that you've been curious about but haven't tried yet?

"Hi all. A brief intro…51 yo female diagnosed with oral cavity cancer in 2004 - non smoker, non HPV - 22 surgeries, partial glossectomy, missing lower teeth due to cancer surrounding the tissue and thus had to be removed. Talk with a noticeable lisp and mainly existing on a liquid diet 
Currently undergoing immunotherapy (Keytruda) 

I am struggling lately more so than I ever have during my 20+ year journey with this horrific disease. I used to lie to myself that I was not chronically ill. I maintained my positivity until I was no longer able. My only child left for college last fall and it’s fair to say the wheels have fallen off. I kept it together for 18 years so my daughter wouldn’t be scared. 

The Keytruda has made me far sicker than the cancer ever did. In addition to playing side effect roulette each day when I wake up I cannot stop crying. I am angry at the cancer and I hate how small my world has become (basically shuttling between my house and treatment). I think my husband stays because he feels badly for me. We once had a great love that has settled (I think in large part to my illness) into a roommate situation. I feel like I am just waiting to die and as stated the tears won’t stop. I have the most amazing friends yet I am still so lonely. I feel as though not one person in my orbit truly understands what I am going through. I feel so alone and so scared.

However, I do want to challenge the idea that the Keytruda is making you sicker than the cancer.

"I’ll try to make this short . My grandmother is about 78. Always been very healthy and gets around great , plans everything . A few years ago probably sometime around Covid we noticed she might ask frequent questions over and over again. My grandpa said they took her to the hospital and doctor said it most likely was due to “Covid brain”🙄 brain fog from getting Covid . So that’s what my grandpa ran with when anyone asked about grandmas memory . She also was quick to catch herself when she asked the same questions over and over again and would say “ugh Covid brain” well the last year we’ve really started to decline rapidly . She got lost when she was driving , she asked me the same question 3 times within 5 minutes . Doesn’t remember big life events . My dad finally pressed my grandpa that she needed a specialist and went with them . The doctor did a few test and we figured that it would take a few weeks to get an answer but to my dads surprise he told him before the appointment ended that she definitely had Alzheimer’s . That she would need family support and that she shouldn’t be driving anymore . We’ve been trying to research stages and figure out how long we have until she completely forgets . Keep in mind she’s most likely had this about 3 years now before her actual diagnosis 
Some things she can’t remember 
• she doesn’t remember he nephew had a child
•she asked my grandpa (her husband of 30 years ) how he’s related to rose (his sister ) . She’s asked this about 4 times . 
• can’t remember to take her medicine 
•doesn’t remember she went to Ireland with all of us

"I have been seeing my current boyfriend for nearly 3 months now, dating officially for 1, and we have only gone so far as to makeout. He is a virgin and is extremely sweet and respectful of women, however I know his sex drive is there, he isn't ace, but he doesn't want to have sex with me. We also have known each other for 3-4 years now, him being a regular figure in my household being my brother’s best friend.
I am not a virgin, rather i started having sex at 15 with my first boyfriend due to pressure from him, which naturally evolved into a sexually abusive and manipulative relationship. Similar experience with my second partner. In those relationships i was essentially reduced to my body and what i could offer physically, or how willing/“freaky” i could behave. This led to me developing a hypersexual attitude towards sex and relationships. I didnt know romantic love that didn’t revolve around sex and submission. 

He knows about all that and we have had conversations about my experiences and the resulting sensitivity i feel around rejection and sex as a whole. That isn't to say i don’t respect his rejection. Whenever he stops intimacy, i stop as well and we go back to cuddling as prior. I just want to understand why. I am no longer hypersexual as I used to be but i still retain some of that rejection sensitivity, the ever-recurring affirmation that if he pushes me away or doesn't want to have sex, then Im not what he wants. I’m temporary and he doesnt want to waste his time, or that im too used to want anymore.
He says he thinks im hot (as well as pretty, and all the other green flag words dw), he says it doesnt have to do with religion and he isnt waiting until marriage, but he says things like “..but we arent having sex for a LOONGG time.”

Sometimes it seems like he is serious about me and even thinks he could marry me, but other times i can feel him pulling back or withdrawing like he doesnt want to get too excited or invested in me. Ive had a number of relationships and flings, not all of which were sexual, but he gives me that look all the time, the “I cant enjoy this too much because I know you're just going to find someone better and leave soon. this is temporary” look. That sucks because for the first time ever I actually can see someone being my forever person and not being angry or abusive.
I guess im just worried he thinks im used up or too fragile or not worth losing his virginity to. I dont even want to have sex at this point in the relationship, im just confused why thats not in the cards for in a few months. 
Please give me some perspective on this. Thank you.","It's understandable that you're feeling confused and frustrated about the situation with your boyfriend, but it's important to remember that everyone moves at their own pace when it comes to intimacy.

This could include setting aside dedicated time each day to check and respond to messages, or even trying a digital detox and limiting your phone use altogether.

"How do you figure out who you really are when ADHD makes you feel like a chameleon?

I’m 23, and I’ve struggled for a long time with feeling like I don’t have a real personality. I also have bipolar disorder, but I think my ADHD plays a big role in this too.

I have interests and things I like, but deep down, it feels like I’m constantly mimicking other people. Whether it’s how I dress, talk, or present myself, I’m usually just pulling from people I admire or think are cool. My style is all over the place, and I think a lot of that comes from wanting to be liked. I care way too much about how people see me, and that’s made me kind of a pushover.

I often feel like I’m a chameleon, changing depending on who I’m around, instead of being grounded in who I am. I’m confident in how I look physically, but I don’t feel confident about who I am on the inside.

I really want to build a stronger sense of self, and feel comfortable being me — even if that changes sometimes. I want to stop overthinking everything I do and just feel more genuine.

"My husband (M30) and I (F28) have been together for 10 years. We are not legally married but we have lived together for 5 years and in our state that makes us domestic partners. We have both changed so much individually and as a couple. There is one recent change, however, that has completely altered our relationship and I'm afraid of what the next steps might be. 

From the very moment we met I was sure about one thing for my future. I wanted to adopt children in lieu of having my own. Anyone i told said that i would grow out of it someday but I never have. I have always felt very strongly about this. From a very young age, I was sure of how I wanted to start my family. I understand not everyone is comfortable with adoption so when my husband and I started dating I made that very clear to him. That I was only interested in adoption and had no plans of birthing any biological children. He accepted that and never said anything negative about it. 

I have never wavered. Anytime we talk about our future family it was always in the pretense of adoption. I made it clear at every opportunity I could and he never said anything different. That was until two years ago. He started making small comments on how we would make cute children or smart children or whatever. I would agree but also followed up with a, ""but I guess we will never know."" And he let it go everytime. In hindsight, i should have known then that he wasnt being honest about his wants. Every couple of months he would just make small comments like that so I would remind him of our plan and he would immediately agree. That was until a few days ago.

After his best friends wedding, who also just had a baby, my husband admitted to me that he wants his own biological children. That we can adopt too but he wants ""his own"". I felt and still feel very hurt. He asked me to think about it more and I didnt say anything. I was just so stunned he felt this way. Had he always felt this way? I believed we wanted the same things. If we do adopt AND have our own I dont believe he will treat them equally. I believe he will treat his biological children with bias and do the bare minimum for the adopted child. At that point, it just defeats the whole purpose.

I love my husband so much and if we wants his own biological children then I don't want to get in the way of that but I also don't want to be apart of it. I want him to have the future he wants but I also want the same for myself. I feel so hurt and like I just wasted years of my life because he couldn't just be honest with me. I'm afraid of starting over after being with him for so long but it's clear that our wants for life are pulling us in different directions. I'm glad he was finally honest with himself and had the courage to tell me but I believe this marks the end for us. I'm looking into apartments, trying to figure out what I can afford and get out of our house as soon as possible. I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm tired and i can't believe that this is where I'm at.







","I'm sorry to hear that you and your husband have different ideas about starting a family. It's important to remember that everyone's circumstances and priorities change over time. While adoption may have been your initial plan, it's understandable that your husband's desire for biological children has emerged. It's unfortunate that this has come as a surprise to you, but it might be worth exploring the possibility of both adoption and having biological children. Many families choose this route, and it could be a way for both of you to have what you want. Ultimately, the most important thing is the well-being and happiness of any future children.

"EDIT - we met up this morning and he ended it. He said he’s told me a million times that he is secular and that the main reason that “tipped him over the edge” was the fact that I have been making out that he is lying. I was gobsmacked and asked him why this is and he said that he has explained his religion vs traditional culture to me many times and that because I “keep asking him about it” it makes him think that there is no trust. I told him that that is not the case at all and that whilst I remember bits of what he’s told me about his tradition and his views there has never been any conversation about what he expects from myself. I also reminded him that a few weeks ago I proactively brought it up and said that I wanted to understand it more (when we were chilling and watching TV) and he said he was too tired to chat about it. He responded by saying that that is beside the point… he then walked off. 😔😔😔


We’ve been dating for 6 months now (I’m 36f and he’s 38m) and everything had been going great. We have had little disagreements but they’ve been dealt with in an emotionally mature way. I love this man so much and honestly thought he was/is the one so I feel heartbroken and torn apart . 

I attended a Sunday dinner at my boyfriend’s auntie’s house last week and felt confused and out of place because I was the only non-Christian attendee. My boyfriend told me that it would be a religious affair and that there would be singing. I assumed that it would be fun singing but instead it was incredibly formal and more like hymns. 

I called him this morning to talk through the dinner from last Sunday because I was still mulling it over. He tells me he’s not religious but then he knew all the prayers by heart, so I’m confused. During the phone call I start asking him questions about it and I tell him that I’m confused. He reacts badly and says that this conversation is weird. I reiterated that I didn’t have a bad time at the thinner but that it was way more formal than I thought it would be and I did express some concerns about my role in this. Would I be expected to go to these dinners on a regular basis? Do I need to know the hyms? Etc et  

Fast forward 6 hours, he texts me and I can tell he is super pissed off, he is saying that he is not religious but practices the traditions and that he feels like I misinterpreted him and his family and he feels disrespected. I explain that I am not trying to poke him but instead I’m wanting to learn about it so that I can take things on board for our future. I also told him that I flew to the Middle East years ago to work for a Christian aid think tank… So I am definitely not opposed to the religion. And I was still so confused as to Why has he taken this the wrong way?? I’m confused about the distinction between what is a tradition and what is religion and what role (if any I would I’ve to play).  The only thing that I specifically thought we had discussed is having our children baptised but he said this would be a tradition which I agreed with. 

He then started to get angry and said “I am not a religious Christian who is practising but I was born one. And the fact that I am having to convince you that I am not Christian is weird and unacceptable and I will never justify myself to anyone. My family are my world and you have issues with them. I am appalled that I asked you to be my girlfriend. I couldn’t care about religion but this is my culture and I won’t tolerate being interrogated by you ever again. We can chat tomorrow”. 

Any advice on how I navigate this? I genuinely want to understand and support him but he’s taken my questions as disrespect. Has anyone else dealt with similar situations where your partner identifies with a religion culturally but claims not to be religious? How do I approach this without him feeling attacked? And did my actions warrant his angry reaction? 😫😫😫

Edit: Something I just remembered, he has been working flat out for most of our relationship and has a new job in accounting. He has told me numerous times that at this moment in time (over the next 6 months or so), he has de-prioritised social events with friends but still made time to see me. He said that once his probation ends he will become more “normal” with his work life balance. So I think what I was trying to get at is how often would 
 I have to attend these things when his work has calmed down as last night was the first time. I did not communicate that to him btw which I should have done 

Also an example of our past disagreements… he has loads of photos on Facebook of him with loads of girls out partying (these photos are months apart and not every weekend). And in about 7/8 photos he has his arms wrapped around girls with them kissing his cheeks. In the first month of us dating I showed my friend his Facebook and she saw all of the photos, and said that he looks like a player. Prior to this I had only seen two of these types of photos and had not done a detailed look at his FB like my friend so I had a wierd feeling about it. I called him up a few hours later when she’d gone and asked him about it calmly. I remember saying that I want to understand why these photos are there because it infers that you’re not after a relationship? I also followed up with that I get the opposite impression from you in real life so it’s confusing for me. He got very very defensive and said that he can have any photos that he wants on social media etc etc and that I should trust him for who he is in person. I can’t exactly remember how the conversation ended but he reassured me that he doesn’t want a casual fling. So maybe this is contributing to how he’s feeling now ",It's unfortunate that this situation has escalated to a breakup. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their beliefs and cultural practices. It seems that there may have been a misunderstanding about the nature of his religious identity and the implications for your relationship. Perhaps it would be helpful to have an open and respectful conversation about your concerns and try to gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives. It might also be worth considering seeking the advice of a relationship counselor or therapist to help facilitate this conversation and find a way forward that works for both of you.,oppose
"Hi all.

I've been on a rough journey over the last year+, each day has been a battle, and I feel like I'm hitting a critical point. My nervous system is flaring, feeling overwhelm from multiple problems coming from multiple angles. I'm really keen to hear others' experience and advice who might've walked similar paths or if you just might have anything to share.

I wish I could write in short bullet points but it doesn't feel easy leaving out context. I don't even know if all this will hit the nail on the head. But for now I'll try keep each part (relatively) concise:

**1) Family** \- At 30, I've realised my parents display narcissism and codependency. They tried to control me while on holiday, contacting me multiple times several hours and chasing/coercing me to go back to hotel by 9PM for safety, promising not to leave, etc. In general I've had to check-in every 1-3 days or they panic if I don't look at my phone overnight and consider next steps calling police etc. I felt drained needing to be hypervigilant. This led me to drawing boundaries in a thoughtful letter, because I want to reach out on my own timeline.

My father responded with gaslighting, guilt, sarcasm, and has now used silent treatment on me over the last 4 months. Mum is encouraging me to call/basically apologise because that's the pattern we've always known. She says he is always going to want me to check-in when I travel (almost as a non-negotiable in order to have a relationship). So I feel trapped being forced to remain a child with no right to freedom of choice, or go low/no contact and virtually no longer have much of a relationship with them.

She also still tries to check-in every \~2 days, and when I've taken a week off my phone, she spams each day in anxiety. It's also burned me out because I've tried explaining myself to her over multiple 2-3 hour phone arguments / texts that I need space, I'm 30, it's not my responsibility to manage their emotions etc, to still just be met with the same behaviours.

I've been working with a therapist who is brilliant and familiar with these themes. But it's very painful beginning to feel how trapped I am, to either feel coerced into living on a mental leash, or having no family relationship. The grief, loneliness, concern of no financial backup altogether feel stressful. Any potential confrontation with my parents also feels like a huge looming thing to dread every day I wake up.

**2) Work** \- This is hard to write because I've just about had enough, and it's a bitter pill having to try re-explain all this in text. My nervous system is flaring up. Ultimately, I'm reaching complete mental fry and burnout from my job. The senior team just want more, more, more sales, bring in more work, yet they've already made us an incredibly 'lean' team (too little people). I'm ultimately a central co-ordinator, pulling together multiple teams work, making and executing large plans.

Since starting at this role, I've been thrown from 1 frying pan straight into the next, filled with high urgency, rushing and hypervigilance, to launch a product. Energy drained in internal team debates and solving problems, painstakingly re-doing things to do the best for the product. A lot of heavy-lifting and overextending to do to get things over the line in very short periods. I'd be able to pull energy together, hyperfocus, overextend and deliver very high quality work in sprints, but it's been over 12 months straight and it's been consistently like this. I moved to this new town for this job - and I've had no social life besides 2 days a week at the office, I only have bandwidth for work.

Last week, I felt my blood boiling in a meeting because I'd just come off launching a huge project, and I was now given 5-6 complex presentations/plans to draw up within 1-2 weeks to complete. Each are highly cerebral, complicated, and branch into 10s of actions and meetings to discuss, find out, calculate, etc. I feel I've just finished a marathon and am forced to go straight into a next, out of breath.

I called my manager into a meeting and broke down, face red, streaming with tears. Including how much the isolation has built up due to the burnout as well. I was basically met with a relatively corporate, straight face with advice to try simplify the jobs (which is frustrating as it's asking me to deliver poorer quality work), that the work isn't really decreasing, and spacing things out just a bit more. Overall, I've felt senior leadership at this place is quite cold, corporate, demanding and not that sensitive to employees' strain.

Within next days, already feeling on my last legs mentally, I was told senior leadership want to drive more sales for a specific product, and that they're asking me to work up and pitch a brand new advertising plan within 48 hours. It took 3 days of straight game-planning with team, lots of problem-solving, but managed to create a plan. Senior leadership continued to push with follow-up questions and requests, but I managed to wrap it up. Exhausted and strained.

Most of all, I've been working on a video as part of my plan, which was really important to me and wanted to add to my portfolio, but kept getting pushed back partially from other urgent tasks getting in front of it, daily admin, plus my exhaustion allowing it to keep rolling into the next day. Manager said he spoke to senior leadership and they've agreed to cancel it, because he thinks it's taken too long - when actually, I feel it's still totally a net-positive for an enriching promotional video to release just a few weeks after a product's launch (which will be up for sale for a long time). I'd taken hours organising, writing, filming, feeding back on this. The talent involved spent hours as well and I really wanted the world to see the amazing content they have to share.

I tried to justify, and he said he'll take a look at it, but it's going to be a fight to have it go out now, and I'll now need to come up with a good justification piece on how/why it should still go out.

The cancellation of this video I feel has been a straw that has broken the camel's back. I'm nerves fry thinking about the injustice, that the work is going to keep coming in, and I'm keen to look for a new job.

However, the exhaustion comes in waves. Sometimes I feel kind of numbed out. I also think I might have to try manage lowering my expectations across everything (from work, to family reconciliation, this timeline, chores), because I feel the strain when I feel my energy's at 0.5 yet my expectations require a 6 for example.

**3) Loneliness / Isolation:** I've written out the below, yet it feels like there's still so much more, and doesn't really nail it on the head. I'll share what I can for now anyway. As mentioned, I moved out from a capital city to a small town for this job. The work and family situation have drained me so much, I've been cocooning at home out of desperation to recharge. By each weekend, I feel I'm swimming to grab onto the side of the pool, desperate for alone time with no plans.

However, it's led to 12 months+ with almost consecutive weeks of being alone in 4 walls, besides 2 days at the office where I burn energy masking. My only socialising is online groups (thankful for them). I've had 0 bandwidth to try maintain so many social media inbox conversations across different friends/family, so for now I've virtually paused being in touch with almost all of them, and I mostly keep up with a main close friend at the moment.

The loneliness makes me want to connect and speak with someone, but at the same time, my mind is so fried I can't fathom talking about the problems anymore. I've repeated the trauma so much I feel I can't get words out. I feel just want to sit in silence with someone, with few words. When I recently spoke to my friend, I had so much to unload that after 3 hours, I was burned out and couldn't speak anymore either. The negating forces between loneliness and social burnout is real.

Now in the heightened burnout, the isolation/loneliness is flaring and bites at me every few times an hour. Sometimes I feel I can't get words out, yet my mind is full. Earlier I felt like I was heading towards cracking up being alone with my problems for so long. I felt like I was in a vacuum just typing to people on the PC every single day.

I felt I really need in-person human company, yet I've avoided that due to repeated overstimulation and stress making me withdraw.

\-----------

I'm concerned I'm sleepwalking into burnout and I'm not fully aware of what extremes might come next - eg. the ground collapsing from under me and I just feel work has driven me crazy that I can't work at all anymore. This fuels concern of losing my job, not being able to get a new job in time, being out on the streets, etc.

Overall, I feel trying to address all of this with senior leadership would be like talking to wolves in sheep's clothing. I've seen a previous colleague take several months of mental health leave, then get let go. The vibes people gave when that person was away made it feel like people didn't have much sympathy for their struggle either. Hence I feel I need to somehow harness energy to put on a front and push through at least until I can find a different role maybe.

I wanted to write like 10 succint bullet points, but this turned into paragraphs again. Anyway, I ultimately am just so interested to hear others' perspectives on navigating these issues in culmination. Any advice on any of the points is greatly appreciated. I wanted to post because I'm curious of peoples' perspectives on experiencing all 3 of these things at the same time in a crunch as well.

Huge thanks for reading once again, and for any thoughts. In case I might not be able to answer individual comments, please know your time and input is hugely, hugely appreciated. Thank you!","I'm really sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing with both your family and work situation. It's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and burned out. However, I'd like to offer a slightly different perspective.

While it's clear that both your family and work are causing you significant stress, it might be worth considering if there are any steps you can take to improve the situations rather than just leaving them behind.

They don’t want to be together, obviously they broke up for a reason, but I’m worried she’ll want to try and work things out for the sake of the baby if it is his and he has always wanted to be a dad.

Me and my siblings are going through a lot right now and we simply can't make a decision. It's constant feeling of push and pull in the mind.

"I am writing this to just share what I have still in my heart. 

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down. Anyways, I was a fighter and got to know that it has higher chances of survival so I fought and finally I won Cancer in Dec if 2018 itself. Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it. 

So, now while I have recovered and doing all well, It broke me. My mind is not as sharp as it was. I am always angry, frustrated, mean and need support for decisions. It broke me! I am not what I was earlier and may never be.

"Scaling language models unlocks impressive capabilities, but the accompanying computational and memory demands make both training and deployment expensive. Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.","While the MoR framework seems interesting, I'm curious if there have been any experiments comparing its performance with other efficiency techniques, such as pruning or quantization, across various datasets and tasks? It would be valuable to have a more comprehensive understanding of its strengths and limitations.",oppose

It wasn’t even about the nicotine after a point. It was about escaping. About avoiding the slightest swirl of anxiety or whatever was bubbling under the surface. The smoke break felt like a breather from life, but looking back… I wasn’t breathing at all. I was just looking for ways too sabotage and find a reason to smoke.

"Ranting for a minute. 

I am so bloody tired of people acting like I haven't tried to get help before this, like I've just sat back and twiddled my thumbs for years, while the world fell apart around me. 

I have tried for decades to get serious help. I have been to Area Agency on Aging. I have been to various government agencies. I have asked for cleaning help, with transportation and so on.  I have tempted and worked full and part time.  I've been active in the community.  

My parents went for clean enough to be functional their entire lives.  I've worked out a cleaning schedule and then fallen off it for whatever reasons since I first learned about Sidetracked Home Executives, way back when.

Mostly I was told not that I couldn't do anything because I didn't own the house. Or that I had to wait until they didn't care, like with Dad's Parkinsons. It never got to that stage. Or cleaning - either the above, or we can't get you help until you fix this - well, Dad refused to ""fix this"" (one of the few times I was absolutely livid with my Father). I tried, but failed. It wasn't until after he passed that I learned it wasn't a drywall problem, and that then has led on a trail of several places who have said they'd fix it, and each then ghosted us. The last guy scammed us out of $7k and basically disappeared.  I've been  stuck in a circle trying to track him down.  One place sayd check here. That place sends me back to the first place. 

Same for the other problems.  We practically had the car rebuilt last year, several things broke throughout the year. 

Could I have done better? Of course.  Hindsight is always 20/20. I've made mistakes; I'm not going to lie. I'm not perfect. But damn it, I have tried to get help for a very bloody blessed long time. Shaming me or anyone else is not frigging helpful!

Some of you seem to think I should have chucked my parents in a nursing or old age home and forgot about them. That's not who I am. I've seen that done; Mom had a rest home ministry for years. My Grandma spent years in the resg home. Again, when I checked into it, we needed to sell the 2nd house, at least five years from before when they would go into the home. Again, that has not been an option until this year. 

Of course if I could go back in time, I would. I'd make changes. But Dr. Who doesn't really exist, and that's not possible.

I’m pretty sure I’ve shared my story here. My Mom was diagnosed in 2023 and it was right when I found out I’d be a father for the first time. I’m mostly doing things on my own to take care of mom with occasional help from my Aunt. 

My mom, unfortunately, treats me pretty horribly when I’m bringing her to her treatment and appointments and the grocery store, etc. I thought I was explaining what I was doing in a clear way that would hopefully help and would stick (essentially I remind her that my siblings are not willing to help, and I’m doing what she would have done for her mom if the circumstances were the same. Growing up my mom was a true caregiver.) 

But it really isn’t working. Any suggestions or ways to approach things to help her understand that I’m really only trying my best to help her and am not the bad guy that she is making me out to be.

"Cancer fam! Fellow lung cancer girlie, corgi mom and video journalist here (tossed in a Sluggy pic for an added serotonin boost). I'm hoping to share more real, unfiltered perspectives from our community—especially voices of young adults with cancer—and would love to tap into this group's shared experiences. So question for you all: 

What’s a mainstream narrative about being young with cancer that totally misses the mark or drives you up the wall? Or what do you wish people understood about what it's actually like to face cancer in your 20s, 30s, or 40s?

Would love to hear y'all's thoughts—whether it’s a rant, a reflection, or something you’ve never said out loud before. For instance, one of my pettiest gripes (lol) is being given all sorts of cute labels when I'm just trying to survive...

","I understand where you're coming from, but I think the labels, while not perfect, can provide a sense of community and understanding that many cancer patients might not otherwise have. It's important to remember that everyone's experience with cancer is unique, and we all process things differently.

Main symptoms: Head pressure. Blood pooling. GI Issues. A plethora of other random ones that come and go.

My parents are very much into the ‘take the medication and drugs’ mentality. I was on Topamax, which made me worse. I can’t even handle taking electrolytes without having an adverse reaction. My dad was pushing me to take Hydroxychloroquine and I had to fight HARD against taking it. They want to shove these pills down my throat. A year later my dad said ‘good thing you didn’t take it i’m reading about a ton of side effects coming out now’. I keep telling them how my body CANNOT tolerate meds but they don’t listen. 

They are pushing hard for me to take SSRI’s / Zoloft. I am only depressed because I am in chronic pain (head vice 24/7). I tried nortriptyline once and it skyrocketed my issues and pain ten-fold. I know it’s a TCA/diff drug class. 

What I’m asking for is PLEASE any research that i can share with them (any articles to send them please!) or self experiences of SSRI’s and how they effected someone with LC. I’ll listen to good or bad. I just feel so unheard. I Understand that my parents don’t understand. But I’M the one doing the research, not them.

"Hi everyone,

Over the past few months, I’ve been working on a new library and research paper that unify structure-preserving matrix transformations within a high-dimensional framework (hypersphere and hypercubes).

Today I’m excited to share: MatrixTransformer—a Python library and paper built around a 16-dimensional decision hypercube that enables smooth, interpretable transitions between matrix types like

* Symmetric
* Hermitian
* Toeplitz
* Positive Definite
* Diagonal
* Sparse
* ...and many more

It is a lightweight, structure-preserving transformer designed to operate directly in 2D and nD matrix space, focusing on:

* Symbolic & geometric planning
* Matrix-space transitions (like high-dimensional grid reasoning)
* Reversible transformation logic
* Compatible with standard Python + NumPy

It simulates transformations without traditional training—more akin to procedural cognition than deep nets.

# What’s Inside:

* A unified interface for transforming matrices while preserving structure
* Interpolation paths between matrix classes (balancing energy & structure)
* Benchmark scripts from the paper
* Extensible design—add your own matrix rules/types
* Use cases in ML regularization and quantum-inspired computation

# Links:

**Paper**: [https://zenodo.org/records/15867279](https://zenodo.org/records/15867279)  
**Code**: [https://github.com/fikayoAy/MatrixTransformer](https://github.com/fikayoAy/MatrixTransformer)  
**Related**: \[quantum\_accel\]—a quantum-inspired framework evolved with the MatrixTransformer framework link: [fikayoAy/quantum\_accel](https://github.com/fikayoAy/quantum_accel)

If you’re working in machine learning, numerical methods, symbolic AI, or quantum simulation, I’d love your feedback.  
Feel free to open issues, contribute, or share ideas.

Thanks for reading!","I'm intrigued by your new library and the concept of structure-preserving matrix transformations in high-dimensional spaces. However, I'm not entirely clear on the practical applications and use cases for this in machine learning or other fields.

I’m moving from India to the US in about a month to start my MS in Human Factors Engineering at Tufts Uni, and I can’t stop feeling anxious about everything. I keep telling myself it’ll be fine, that it’s a step in the right direction, but the closer it gets, the more anxious I get.  

I’m switching fields too, from software engineering (which honestly never felt right for me, felt stagnant and repetitive) to HF, which I actually enjoy (Mostly, I like working on researching and designing, understanding how and why any product is build, how the limits and experiences of users can be taken into consideration etc etc). But it’s a big leap, and even though I know I don’t want to just code for a living anymore, that transition is scary.

My plan isn’t to settle in the US long-term. I’d like to explore, and then come back home in 3 to 4 years. If I don't get to work in the US because of some policy changes or OPT being cancelled or whatever, I'll look for a job elsewhere. But that’s another thing.

Anyway, leaving home makes me sad as well. My dogs are getting older, my grandfather too, and I keep thinking they might feel like I abandoned them when they're ageing. I’ve got all my friends and family here. I’m already earning decently with over 2 years of experience, so it’s not like I have to leave. But I feel stuck, and I know I won’t grow if I stay in the same loop forever.

Idk how to find a middle ground with this situation.
How should we approach this?","It's important to respect each other's boundaries in a relationship. However, it seems excessive for your boyfriend to restrict you from hanging out with your male friends completely. Maybe you could suggest setting some guidelines that make both of you comfortable, such as limiting the frequency or duration of your hangouts with male friends, or ensuring that they're in public places. Communication and compromise are key in resolving this issue.",oppose
"I truly want to know if I should reach out or apologize so I can improve and be better for her if I should but honestly want to try to be impartial here. I (28M) have been seeing my girlfriend (33F) for almost a year now, I haven't had any kids and she has two and is divorced.  I was raised by my grandpa and my mom, while my father was absent. As such, my grandpa was my dad. He recently (1 1/2 months ago) passed, and I have been spiraling ever since. Hence my inclination to post here, I don't feel like I'm my normal self so hard to see if I'm thinking wrong here. It feels like there's this massive hole in my life that I'm struggling to adapt to, it hurts so much. Anyways, my girlfriend and I recently had a fight where she acted really harshly and did several out of character things (name calling, cussing me out, pushing me, etc) over how I've been distant and not myself lately. She hasn't lost a parent and I told her about how my loss was impacting me and what it was like. She apologized truly and profusely and wanted me to know she was here for me. Because of her kids, she said she couldn't be there physically always when I needed her (which I totally understand), but would always be there if for me if I texted or called. Well the past few days I've thought of him a lot and felt low. I told her how I was feeling after both of us were off work the past 3 days. She would initially respond and tell me she was sorry and she could only imagine how hard it was. I would try to distract myself by asking how she was or telling her about my day. She then the past 2 nights would ignore my text until 1 am, where I would finally send a goodnight and she would respond and briefly say she was busy. Finally today I texted and told her that hurt me that I tried to reach out for support, and she didn't take it well. She told me I had no idea what it was like to be busy like her and have two kids on top of working and taking care of the household, and it makes her feel pressured that I have such high expectations of her. I agree I don't know what that's like, but I feel that a text takes 5 seconds, and she could at least let me know she's busy and she'll text when she's in a more free spot. She says I'm expecting too much and making her feel like she can't be herself or live her life. I truly accept I don't feel like myself right now and also don't know what it's like to have kids and manage a house hold. So I want to know if I should reach out and apologize, or hold my ground here? Thanks for any comments or advice","I'm really sorry to hear about your loss and the challenges you're facing right now.

While it may be helpful for you to reach out and talk about your feelings, it's also crucial to consider her perspective.

"I just can't keep living like this. When I was a kid, I dealt with so much bullshit, with poverty making it worse. I remember constantly starving, being kicked out of a home either because my parents couldn't afford rent or they just didn't want me around, staying without power constantly bc bills were unaffordable, having no pads and getting in trouble at school because of it, etc. I thought maybe I could make life better for myself once I'm older. Instead, it feels like the world just crumbled as soon as I turned 18.

COVID-19 happened as soon as I graduated from high school, and the prices just soared on everything. Entry-level jobs were so difficult to get—I signed up for almost every job position in my area more than once and was denied. Can't afford college at all, and a scholarship wouldn't help, like I need a grant, yet I'm not able to sign up for FAFSA independently until I'm 25 or 26, apparently (my parents refused to provide the info that would help me sign up). Credit is already shit because I have medical debt as soon as I turned 20, just because my state didn't expand Medicaid and took mine away without any warning.

Found a job, but had to quit because both my physical and mental health fell to the crapper and constantly interfered with my ability to work to the point it pissed off my boss and coworkers whenever I had to suddenly leave, take a break, call off work, etc. Yet, I can't afford to treat my issues because I'm uninsured and can't afford ACA insurance. Every non-profile health organization is so damn far away from where I live and I have no transportation or money for bus tickets. I'm in pain every single fucking day, intense pain nearly all over my body that won't stop, and sometimes makes it hard to walk straight. As for my mental health, I've been struggling with this for years because my parents refused to take me to see a psychiatrist or therapist, making me go years without a proper diagnosis, always having a mental battle, and leaving me struggling in almost everything I do. But, I can't afford to do anything about it as an adult either.

Still dealing with food insecurity too. Every month, I'm able to get a little bit of food because of food stamps paying so little for it, but once that runs out, I'm always starving until the next Food stamp payment. I've been very underweight since I was a kid and was never able to gain weight even to this day. It makes me feel so cold all the time, even in summer so I have to wear a hoodie almost 24/7. This was also the reason I had to quit because when I was working, standing for many hours straight made me feel very dizzy and my boss didn't want me to sit all the time. 

I also have about three chipped teeth that are yet to be seen by a dentist and gum disease, but obviously, I can't afford to get this taken care of. And the crazy thing is, there is literally no dental school in my city that will work with low-income patients (there are about two, but they only do dental work for those with braces and the other for dentures).

I've exhausted my options for everything, searched every nook and cranny for solutions and I'm just so tired. I refuse to live through this any longer, and I'm contemplating whether to let sepsis get me from my teeth or to end things early.

I’m 24 female diagnosed with stage three uterine cancer. My first doctor told me I could save me eggs but I needed a full hysterectomy. I had an mri and he wouldn’t share my mri results until I had a second opinion. I went to Moffit for a second opinion and decided to stick with that doctor. The very first appointment I told her how important having children was to me and asked for recommendations to a fertility clinic. She said there was no need because she wasn’t going to remove my ovaries. She reiterated this at 2 other appointments I had with her. After a second dnc and mri she informed me that everything needs to go and I will probably need chemo so there’s no use in leaving my ovaries there anyways. I’m so heartbroken. The only thing I’ve wanted was children. And I tried to ask for resources to save my eggs. I can’t help but feel upset. I will never have children of my own.

"I just watched something that completely changed how I think about ApoE4 and Alzheimer's risk.

For years, we've been told that carrying ApoE4 means one thing: dramatically higher Alzheimer's risk. Period. End of story.

But what if that's only half true?

Dr. Aura Ramirez just presented research that shows ApoE4 behaves COMPLETELY differently depending on your ancestry. Not just ""a little different""—we're talking about fundamental molecular changes in how the gene functions.

Here's what blew my mind:

🧬 **Discovery #1: African ancestry contains a ""genetic brake"" that naturally suppresses ApoE4 expression.** When researchers used CRISPR to remove this brake, ApoE4 expression shot up, but ONLY in African cells. European cells? No change.



🧠 **Discovery #2: In European and African brains, ApoE4 creates a dangerous imbalance:** ramping up cholesterol production while shutting down myelin (the insulation that keeps your neurons firing properly). It's like building more gas stations while letting the highways crumble.



🌎 **Discovery #3: Amerindian brain cells flip the entire script.** Their ApoE4 actually REDUCES cholesterol pathways and INCREASES myelination. Same gene, opposite effect.



**This is both fascinating science AND hope.**

Because if some populations have naturally evolved protection against ApoE4, maybe we can learn to replicate it. Maybe risk isn't as fixed as we thought. Maybe your genes aren't your destiny after all.

I've been diving deep into this research, and just posted a full breakdown on YouTube.

**If you carry ApoE4, or care about someone who does, this might be the most important 15 minutes you spend today. Remember to share it if you believe it might help someone else!**

Because the more we understand about how ancestry shapes genetic risk, the closer we get to truly personalized prevention.

What ancestry are you? Have you noticed differences in how Alzheimer's affects your family compared to others? I'd love to hear your thoughts below.","I'm glad to see new research emerging on the complex relationship between ApoE4 and Alzheimer's risk.

I'm 25 btw, the 35 is a typo!!

So I'm in a healthy relationship and have been for almost 4 years. We live together and we're planning on buying a house and getting married.

The person I was with before this relationship was a long time childhood friend who broke up with me suddenly, out of the blue with little explanation.

I was very surprised and upset about the break up at the time and never got any closure as to why he ended things.

As we were childhood friends, we shared a friendship group and have continued to share a friendship group, meaning we are often at the same social events together but I deliberately don't speak directly to him or seek out any interaction with him, as I feel like our friendship ended when our relationship did, but I do keep things civil.

He started to date another girl in my friendship group recently and I was speaking to her and explaining how I was happy for her as she has been dating a string of horrible (almost abusive) men and I was glad that she was choosing a safe guy.

She then confessed to me that she has been sleeping with him for years and that they actually slept together when me and him were dating. She told me that the reason why he broke up with me suddenly was because he felt guilty for cheating on me and that he had been confiding in her that he wanted to break up with me because he felt bad about sleeping with her.

She was surprised that this was news to me and I tried to keep a poker face, and not seem upset.

I now feel conflicted, on the one hand, this was over 4 years ago, almost 5 years probably, and I'm in a happy and healthy relationship, but I now feel so blindsided by this, especially as she was someone I considered a friend.

I've not spoken to my partner about this because I don't want him to think I'm still hungup on my past relationships.

Edit; thanks for all the advice and reassurance! I spoke to my current boyfriend about it, a few hours ago and he was really understanding and supportive. We then went on a nice walk and had a nap (we're both a bit hungover). I think I'm going to take a break from seeing all of that group for a while and then *maybe* try and figure out who knew but I think that it may just upset me further.

"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.
","I appreciate your perspective and the valuable insights you've shared about caring for elderly individuals with Alzheimer's. Your experiences have certainly highlighted some challenges that can arise and the importance of being prepared.

However, I would like to share a different perspective regarding the use of keyed locks on doors. While I understand the safety concerns, I have heard concerns from some caregivers that these locks can create a sense of distrust and make the person with Alzheimer's feel more confused and agitated. They might not remember why the doors are locked and feel trapped, leading to increased anxiety and potentially dangerous behavior.

Instead, some caregivers suggest exploring alternative methods, such as keeping the doors unlocked and",oppose
"So I was rear ended in Feb of 2024, my lawyer called today and said he was able to settle and I will be receiving about 20k in pain and suffering damages. Because of the accident we had to take out a loan for a car and bought a 2024 Toyota Corolla. At the time the loan was 27k 640/month. We aggressively paid down the loan over the last year and half so now it's 13k. We refinanced and got a lower interest rate and payment is now 315/month. We are currently sharing the vehicle to get ourselves to work, myself to college and our daughter to preschool. My question is, would it be better to use the money to pay off the loan and use the rest as down payment for another car or use it all to buy a 2nd car cash?

I would like to get a used RAV4 or Nissan Rogue but any that I look at are 25k with 30000 miles. ","While I understand the desire to use the settlement money wisely, I think it's important to consider the potential long-term benefits of keeping the loan and using the settlement to buy a second car. Having two cars could provide more flexibility and convenience for your family, especially with work, school, and potential future emergencies. However, it's crucial to do the math and make sure the combined car payments don't put too much strain on your budget. Additionally, consider the potential savings from eliminating the need for public transportation or ride-sharing costs. Ultimately, it's a personal decision that depends on your financial situation and priorities.",oppose
"Hey everyone — I’ve been dealing with a lot of ADHD-related burnout lately, and sound has been one of the few things that helps me stay grounded during long stretches of executive dysfunction, overthinking, or just… nothingness.

"Hi everyone,

I’m currently working on a research project where I’m trying to apply **contrastive learning** to **FreeSurfer-based brain data** (structural MRI features) and **biomarker data** (tabular/clinical). The idea is to learn a shared representation between the two modalities.

The problem: I am **completely lost**.

* I’ve implemented losses like **NT-Xent** and a few others (SupCon, etc.), but I can’t get the approach to work in a meaningful way.
* I’m struggling to figure out the best architecture or training strategy, and I’m honestly not sure what direction to take next.
* There is **no proper supervision in my lab**, and I feel stuck with how to proceed.

I really need guidance from someone experienced in contrastive learning or multimodal representation learning. Ideally, someone who has worked with **medical imaging + tabular/clinical data** before. (So it is not about classical CLIP with Images and Text).

I’m **willing to pay** for mentoring sessions or consulting to get this project on track.

"I had a teratoma tumor (Stage 1B) with a neoplasia in situ (stage 0) and had surgery 5 weeks ago and feel great honestly, pre-surgery I thought I was dying and after surgery I have improved in every way so when I got the final diagnosis it felt like, okay this is finally done with and can move on, but then they did blood tests and the numbers are way off and now, suddenly they are raising serious concerns and now ports, PET scan and 3 month of aggressive chemo by the tumor board is pushing for immediate action even though, I'd like to see more blood tests given the time frame.

The tumor also produced large amounts of estrogen which caused significant body changes contributing to pain as well.

* **Left testis, radical orchiectomy:**
* **Organ-confined post-pubertal type teratoma:** The tumor is a teratoma (a type of germ cell tumor) that is confined within the testis and has not spread beyond it. ""Post-pubertal type"" refers to a form of teratoma that occurs after puberty, which behaves differently from pre-pubertal teratomas.
* **Spermatic cord margin negative for tumor:**
* **Pathologic stage pT1b pNX (AJCC 8th edition):**
   * **pT1b:** The tumor is limited to the testis but has certain features such as size or involvement that place it in this specific category.
   * **pNX:** Lymph nodes were not assessed or cannot be assessed (meaning they don't have conclusive data on lymph node involvement from this specimen).
* **No yolk sac tumor identified despite elevated AFP:** Although your blood tests showed elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a marker often elevated in yolk sac tumors, none was found in the tissue examined. They checked carefully using special stains (immunohistochemistry) and didn't find clear evidence of yolk sac tumor cells.
* **Small focus of germ cell neoplasia in situ:** This means there are some abnormal germ cells present in the testis that could be the source of elevated beta-hCG levels (another tumor marker).
* **Overall: Post-pubertal type teratoma with no clear evidence of other germ cell tumor components.**

It was removed with no evidence of more aggressive tumors, with clear margins and no invasive spread detected.   CT Scan with contrast only detected the 3cm teratoma, everything else looked clear.  X-Ray of the same area revealed bone structure also clear,   CT Scan without contrast of chest also showed clear results.

Pure mature teratoma (no yolk sac, no embryonal carcinoma, no choriocarcinoma).

* Confined to testis with clear margins.
* No lymphovascular invasion reported.

Blood Test Results - Surgery to remove the tumor occurred on June 16th

Estrogen, Blood, Serum  
June 5th 390  
July 8th 340

LD  
June 5th 1087  
July 8th 1300

This is a concern, but I had surgery and a hematoma formed, which could be a reason for this?

Beta-HCG, Quantitative  
June 5th 2050  
July 8th  1750

AFP

June 5th 321.4  
July 8th 560

This is the concerning part, also the surgery was on June 16th which could further increased the AFP in the time frame,  this is likely the cause of the concern and subsequent Chemo request?

No actual checks of the lymph nodes were done because the tumor was supposedly removed with clear margins,  The surgeon also detected a hematoma in the removed testis part which could also raise certain levels.

**Bottom line, here - is there a benign reasoning for this, should I request another blood marker panel first before just jumping straight into 3 months of destructive chemo,   I can still feel firmness on the surgery site given its still healing, and can feel the small lump of the hemotoma where the surgeon located it on my two-week post op appointment.**

**I know, microscopic spread was not confirmed, the surgeon started that tumor burn-out was his professional opinion,   I have an appointment with the oncologist on Wednesday and I feel like I should directly request a retest of the Beta HCG, LD and AFP at least,  if the AFP and LD are continuing to rise, that could mean - either microscopic spread or possible hidden tumor somewhere outside of the area's that were tested?**

Reasonable assumptions, could it also mean something sneaked by and infected some lymph nodes that are swollen,   that swelling also does not automatically mean cancer, they could be reactive to the pain, surgery too.

**On top of all this, my house is problematic for chemo therapy in general, we have cats, a dog and a cockatiel,  plus we have limited space, mildew issues and other potential issues.** ","I'm really glad to hear that your surgery went well and that you're feeling better.

"I am a 21 year old male, I've been on a cut for a bit now, going from 245 down to 207 currently and I'm trying to burn off these final pounds. This is the diet I've been using the entire time. 

Breakfast: Catalina Crunch Protein Cereal 36 grams, Oikos triple zero yogurt, Nurri protein shake, 3 slices of canadian bacon, and sometimes a banana.

Lunch: I eat 6 oz of boneless skinned chicken breast, half an ounce of reduced fat shredded cheese, 26 grams of lite ranch, and 30 grams of spinach. I also take 2 fish oil pills, magnesium, ashwagandha, vitamin D and a multi vitamin. 

Dinner: I have a carb balance tortilla with 3 oz of ground beef, another half ounce of shredded cheese and 30 grams of low fat sour cream. 

Shake: I have a protein shake after the gym made with one cup of 1% milk, PB fit (a low fat peanut butter powder), 6 star whey protein, creatine, and collagen peptides.

Snacks: I often have 2 fruit snacks and a rice krispie as carbs before the gym. I also usually eat a single blueberry bagel in the evenings to cure my late night hunger. 

This totals around 2,253 calories, 223 grams of protein, 229 carbs, 61 fat.

 i also should add i went to a rural small town high school where i didn’t have access to a lot of the resources my peers had at other high schools. i go to ucla and as you can imagine that transition was super hard for me not having as strong of a foundation as other people in my major did. 

i constantly scored below the curve and only scored above the curve on a test twice (in calc). i am horrible at the tests. i may feel like i know the material and then get a 40% on it. i did over 60 pages of practice problems to prepare for a physics test and still failed it. i feel like i’m never truly prepared for the tests i take and sometimes my mind just goes blank.

 i just recently got testing accommodations but didn’t have the chance to use them this past year. i feel like i’ve tried everything and it’s just super unmotivating to study more than my peers and score below them. even worse it will be much higher stakes this next quarter as i am on academic probation so i have to improve my grades. do you guys have any advice for my situation?

edit: my current studying habits involve writing down the things i need to do for each day of the week and listing them by priority. what i don’t understand is at the top. i watch videos on the topics im confused on until i feel more confident and then do practice problems over and over and over lol. i also try to start studying 1 or 2 weeks in advance for tests but that’s not always possible. i’m also prescribed ritalin which i try to avoid taking unless i absolutely need it","It's understandable that making the transition from high school to college can be challenging, especially when dealing with a diagnosis like ADHD.

"Hi everyone! This is my first post ever, eek!

I'm F34 and started to seek diagnosis last year for something that can only be ADHD based on the trail of chaos I've left behind since birth. Either that or BPD, but anyway - I've started the journey of understanding my brain a little better with the help of a professional. Only I've realized I'm not sure what I'm really after if I get a diagnosis.

As we all know, in addition to the main course of ADHD, there's many fun side dishes too, and in my case I suffer from (health-)anxiety and I'm afraid to take medications because of side effects. I started wondering if I could ever take ADHD medication. The only ""safe"" meds for me are over the counter painkillers, and my brain has decided they will have to help me with anything that comes my way, because I get severe anxiety about anything else. But that's another matter.

ANYWAY, I got a bit sidetracked (surprised?) but my question is - is there anyone here that is _NOT_ on any ADHD meds (as I feel like literally everyone is on some sort) and why? How do you cope? Do you self-medicate? Or do you just leave it be? Many thanks for any contributions <3

In the meantime I’m rethinking my exercise regimen. I’ve been trying for years now to fully get into weight lifting but the small fitness classes I take tend to wipe me out. I’ve intermittently accepted this and have taken breaks, but I enjoy the community at the gym despite it not being informed on LC. Additionally, I like yoga and intend to try to continue with it. 

Of course my doctor has (though not lately, to her credit) recommended exercise for LC. Historically (RIP the Old Me, but I’m not ready to let her go, ugh) I’ve enjoyed exercise and it helps with my depression and ADHD. Both of which, as I’m sure you know, have become nearly unmanageable with LC. I want to try to find something that feels good enough without fully wiping me out.  Likely a unicorn.

Most people don’t fall because they were weak or lazy.They fall because they were simply distracted, and the worst part?
They just ignore it or never even notice. 

Many are just looking for some deep-rooted trauma or complicated flaw that’s holding them back.
But the truth is… it’s distraction.
Plain, Simple & deadly but its 'overlooked'

Phone, Lust, Food, Mood swings, Self-doubt & more all can be distractions.

We give distractions too much room to enter & thats why its hard to run from it.

No. Because their focus has no room left.

"What level of care does someone who has really variable good days and bad days? 

Good days are where they are coherent in conversation, sometimes self-aware about their confusion and can remember some past events, but may still have short-term memory loops and not be able to cognitively process any technology or schedules or even know the day or time. Bad days are where they are very confused incredibly repetitive, fixated and frustrated, make bad decisions to disregard social norms, and do erratic things like spend all their money on things they don’t need (10 pairs of pants) and “feel dizzy.”

We are in bc Canada and my mom has gone into hospital due to a fall. She had a couple falls the week before she went in and now doesn’t feel safe and can’t probably go back to her independent living building, but she is not on any list for subsidized care as her disease progression has had a steep decline in the last month… We guess the hospital wants her out (she’s been there almost two weeks, nothing seems medically wrong). So they won’t want to let her stay much longer, but they can’t safely discharge to her current level of care. They asked me about our ability to pay for private long term care but pricing it out is outrageous / month 🤑! Assisted care seems like too much freedom not enough support for her to be safe (falls and wandering)… she obviously will need long term care at some point but is now too soon? Should we refuse to discharge her until they find us a subsidized long term bed? Or is keeping her in the hospital too cruel to her dignity and last coherent days with some intermittent capacity ? I’m her primary care giver with a family and a teenager of my own. My dad died in at Xmas and he did everything for them which hid how bad things were. Since then we have moved her to an apartment, cleared their house of 47 years and got her a diagnosis. She just continues to progress faster than I can anticipate. I’m maxed already with so many decisions…","I understand your situation is difficult and I'm sorry for your mom's health issues. However, I don't think it's fair to label good days as ""coherent"" and bad days as ""incredibly repetitive and confused"" without considering the context.

"Location: Oregon 
Hi everyone! I have a legal question, but some background first: my husband and I purchased a home in the Portland Oregon area almost exactly a year ago, which has 5 mature, very beautiful, extremely tall Douglas Firs in the backyard. We were told by our neighbors that the newer houses that abut the back of our property used to all be a Douglas Fir grove, but about 5 years ago, a housing development razed all of the beautiful and historic trees (all of them, didn’t leave a single one standing) to build the houses.

One of the Firs looks a bit sad to me so we had an experienced arborist come assess. They said that it is in decline and we will need to pay to have it removed (the other 4 are doing fine for now). Because there is no longer any safe space to fell the tree, the quote is $16,000 for this work. The arborist said this tree has been slowly dying because the housing development chopped the rest of the grove that was once next to it (on the other side of our property) and destroyed a large part the tree’s root system.

So now to my legal question: can the housing development or HOA be at all held responsible for the death of our tree - albeit somewhat delayed after they removed the rest of the grove? $16,000 is a lot of money and we wouldn’t be out this money if they had built around the Firs (or at least some of them) as our streets houses did back in the early 00’s.","I'm an arborist myself, and while I understand the frustration of losing such a beautiful tree, it's important to note that proving the housing development or HOA is responsible for the tree's death may be challenging. The causation between their actions and the tree's decline could be difficult to establish definitively. Additionally, the cost of removing the tree seems high, have you considered getting quotes from other arborists to compare? It might be worth exploring other options, such as attempting to save the tree or even reaching out to the housing development or HOA to see if they could contribute to the cost.",oppose

TLDR: I have a benign bronchial duplication cyst that makes me wonder if my LC is actually just symptoms of this chest mass and I’m being deceived into thinking I have long COVID be bad doctors. Also had my 16th er visit the other day. 


I’m sure that what everyone here is experiencing is happening, so I don’t mean “oh it’s all in our heads” or whatever. But for me personally I have another issue that makes me doubt if I’m suffering from LC or not. During my first ER appointment they found a noticeable mass in my chest which has been pretty well investigated. It’s a congenital bronchial duplication “cyst.”The thoracic surgeon told me they don’t usually cause the issues I am experiencing, like vision problems and cognitive issues- however they do causes swallowing problems and shortness of breath, chest pressure, that sort of thing. So half of my problems at least could be related to that, and in rare cases maybe even the neuro stuff!! But it’s also rare for these things to even cause noticeable symptoms at all, so I have no way of knowing. 

I would say 80% of doctors I see have never heard of long COVID so when I see someone new they bring up the chest mass and then I start wondering all over again if my problems really are all from this mass and I’m just deluding myself about the long COVID. The rest of the time if people do think it’s COVID I get nothing out of it.

I went to the ER for the sixteenth time in 2 years the other night… I’ve been 16 times for real. It was like 1am and I had been woken up with terrible left sided weird issues again and felt like maybe I was having some cardiac problem. Just awful. Numb, suffocating chest neck left arm, sob, the usual, but worse. The doctor who saw me was good, and she insisted I needed a primary to really be keeping up with me, and told me to be aggressive. She questioned me about the chest mass and refered my cardio thoracic surgery.

I’m just so tired of this. It took me 5 month to even get scheduled with cardiology and it will be another 2 months to get seen. I made 30 phone calls trying to get scheduled. I even sent them the damn ekg they “maybe” needed myself and they never could access it. I’m not sure how to be MORE aggressive, and at this point I hate myself for even being polite anymore. I was never a pushy or demanding person, but now it’s like the fact that I’m not a raging entitled asshole is working against me because the medical system is so bad. 

Having all this uncertainty for 2 years is so draining. Is it the chest cyst? Is it just LC because it has all those symptoms too but you’ll never know because you can’t test for it?? Is it BOTH? What if I end up getting surgery to have it removed and it solves NOTHING and then I have to heal from chest surgery and have long COVID. What if I never even had long COVID and they were wrong about this cyst and it’s pressing on my nerves and that’s why I can’t use my hands properly anymore when I’m upright. 

The cognitive haze is just horrible. The number one thing that makes me think I’m dealing with LC is the brain fog, because no one else is describing it like the people on here who have it. 

I don’t know why I’m even writing this. I know nobody here has an answer either, and everyone is suffering. I just really hope I get some sort of solid answers soon because life where every single one of your senses and activities is impacted is really the final test of endurance","I'm really sorry to hear about your health struggles and the uncertainty you're facing. It's understandable that you're seeking answers and feeling frustrated with the medical system. I can only imagine how challenging it must be to navigate this situation. At the same time, I also want to remind you that having a benign bronchial duplication cyst and experiencing symptoms of long COVID are not mutually exclusive. It's possible that both conditions are contributing to your symptoms. It's important to keep an open dialogue with your healthcare team and advocate for yourself as best you can. I wish you all the best in your journey towards finding answers and relief.

*XPINNs extend standard Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by splitting the problem domain into smaller subdomains. Each subdomain is handled by a smaller PINN, and continuity is enforced via interface conditions. This can help with scaling to more complex problems.*

To make a long story short, looking for one in-game thing, we ended up reasonably by ourselves in a nice shaded area, just hanging out. For at least half an hour.

I didn't say a damn word to her. We had a shared hobby, I could have asked to pet her dog, asked her if she was having any luck catching Pokemon, anything. I just froze and concentrated on the game, and even when she walked off to catch a Pokemon I was about to walk to, I sat there and waited because I worried she'd think I was following her. And I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable just enjoying her hobby and fresh air.

I just froze because I didn't want to ruin her day. I guess my question here is... was that an appropriate place to get to chatting with her? Would I have ruined her day or scared her as a single woman in the park? Should I have talked to her? What should I have said?

I used to be decent with women in my teens and 20s but I've definitely gotten more worried about how they're going to feel, and the apps feel so much safer because I already know there's some mutual interest. Thanks in advance for any advice.","While I understand your apprehension and respect your intentions, I think it's important to remember that every situation is unique. Approaching someone in a public setting can be intimidating for both parties involved. In this particular case, it's unclear whether the woman you were interested in was open to social interaction or not. She could have been engrossed in her game or simply enjoying her own company. It's also important to note that not all women want to be approached in a romantic way in public settings, especially in a male-dominated event where they might feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

TLDR; My older siblings have always acted like I don’t exist and now feel obligated to my time, yet refuse to reach out to me first and claim I’ve shunned them. Told my sister that they’ve never treated me like family, so I don’t feel obligated to do the same, and it’s causing some riffs. I don’t want to play telephone anymore and wanna make that clear that they aren’t shunned, but I don’t owe them anything. Any advice?


I (23F) come from a very large and dysfunctional family, I have 4 siblings and we share the same mother, myself the only one with a different father, and all of my siblings are 10+ years older than I am, so by the time I was old enough to form memories most of them were already in high school or moving out of the house. Growing up I’ve always felt somewhat of a black sheep or an outcast, whether that was because of the age differences, or that I didn’t share a father, or maybe purely because they were sick of my mom having more kids. They never really acknowledged me unless they had to, didn’t really hang out with me, shooed me away every chance they had, even lowkey tortured me as a toddler by locking me in closets and other crazy shit like that so they wouldn’t have to babysit me, etc. 

I was a fairly perceptive kid, I was constantly trying to earn approval somehow, but as I got older I realized that they really didn’t have any interest in being my siblings, and it was more like I was just the mutt my mom decided to keep. Once, when I was 13, my mom admitted to me that when my siblings found out she was pregnant, they immediately told her to get an abortion. I stopped trying so hard, tired of hurting my own feelings from their rejection, and by the time I was in high school I had barely any line of communication with most of my siblings. 

The only one I can give any credit to was my sister Martha (34F), who was the youngest before I was. She was 11 when I was born, and I was her little buddy for the most part until she moved away for college, and even after she moved back to our hometown, she kept an open line of communication with me, in case I ever needed another adult. She took me in at 16 so I could finish high school, after suffering from one of the worst blow out fights of the decade with my mom, deeming it unsafe for me to return home, and we grew closer than ever as I got older.

She was the only sibling who reached out when my dad died earlier this year, and even helped cover some of his funeral costs, plus paid some of my bills when I was going under from all the stress. I owe a lot to her, and I remind her all the time how much I appreciated her stepping up for me when no one else would, despite having significantly less money and time to devote to me than the rest of our siblings, she did everything she could. 

My birthday is coming up in a week, my sister Katherine’s (45F) birthday is 3 days before mine, so Martha recently reminded me to not forget to tell Katherine happy birthday this year. I kinda raised an eyebrow at her, because I never told her I forgot the year before, meaning Katherine must’ve said something to her about it. I told her straight up that Katherine has forgotten my birthday for the past 5 years, so I don’t see why she’d care if she hears from me or not, considering we’re not even really family anyway. The last bit seemed to rub Martha wrong, and she immediately asked what I meant by that. 

I laid it out plainly and told her that Katherine is honestly a stranger to me, we haven’t had an actual conversation in over 6 years, and she refuses to reach out to me first despite being a grown woman, she always has to say something to Martha to relay to me; I wouldn’t really consider that familial communication. Same goes for the rest of them, we haven’t had an actual interaction face to face or even over the phone in just as long, and they’re just as uninvolved in my life as I am theirs, using Martha as a messenger instead of talking to me themselves. Martha tried to wave it off, saying that regardless we’re still related, we’re all still a family, and I can be the bigger person and rise above our siblings’ immature behavior since I have a good head on my shoulders. I flat out told her that no, we aren’t a family, we were never raised to be that way, we’re just a group of people who happened to come out of the same woman. I said that I may be a part of Martha’s family, but I’m not apart of OUR family that we share, and it’s always been made apparent to me.

The convo continued with Martha telling me that I won’t get what I don’t give, and I said the same goes for them, they’re all adults with their own lives and so am I, yet they all make the time to talk to each other, excluding me. I’ve essentially lived my entire life with them not caring about my existence and that it really doesn’t make a difference to me whether they ever reach out to me or not. I didn’t want to continue arguing with her, because I knew that we were just going to have to agree to disagree, so I told her I’ll consider them family when they decide they finally wanna do the same for me and show they genuinely care, not just because they feel I owe them my time solely because they’re older and I’m younger. Since then, Martha hasn’t brought up Katherine, but her husband did tell me that she told Katherine about what I said and now she’s crying to our other siblings wondering “where they went wrong enough to be shunned by OP for no reason.”

I wanna make it clear that they’re not “shunned”, they follow my social medias, they have my phone number, my mailing address, they can reach out anytime if they want to hear from me so badly or feel entitled to my time, but they don’t, and I frankly have enough going on right now that speaking to any of them is the last thing on my mind. I know Martha probably feels hurt and somewhat lumped in with the rest of them from my statement, and I want to apologize to her, but I also want to make it clear to her and our other siblings that I’m not playing telephone with them anymore. I need to make it apparent that I’m noting shunning them, but I frankly owe them nothing.

Any advice for how I can go about this without making it seem like I’m trying to cut them all off? And not like I’m rolling over for them? I’ll take what I can get, thanks. 
","It's understandable that you've had a difficult relationship with your siblings, and it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being. However, it might be worth considering that cutting off all communication could potentially cause more harm than good, especially for your relationship with Martha. Perhaps focusing on setting healthy boundaries rather than completely disconnecting could be a more productive approach. It's okay to express your feelings and let them know how their actions have affected you, but also be open to the possibility of rebuilding some form of connection if they show a genuine effort to change their behavior. Communication is a two-way street, and it's important to remember that everyone involved deserves respect and understanding.",oppose

"We’ve been married for half a year now and nothing’s really changed in how we act (which is a good thing) but I noticed something kind of funny. I still just call him by his first name 99% of the time. No “hubby” no “babe” not even “my husband” unless I’m talking about him to someone else. I don’t know if it’s because we were together for so long before the wedding or if I’m just not a nickname person, but it made me wonder like is that normal? Do most people start using different terms of endearment after marriage or does it usually just stay the same?  
","That's an interesting observation you have there. In my experience, some people do switch to using more affectionate terms after getting married, while others don't. It really depends on the individuals and their relationship dynamics. I personally know couples who have been together for years before getting married and still only use each other's first names.

"
The tittle pretty much sums it up. Me (19M) and my gf (18F) have been together for a year and 4 months, and the start we didn’t go through each other’s phones at all but now we’re very comfortable with eachother, we tell each other everything and are very intimidate and happy together. 
She always posts me on social media, brags about me to her friends (from what I know), and all around she has no red flags besides this (that I know of).

The problem is that I always let her go through my phone. She never “searches” for anything in particular, just randomly when we’re on a date she can take it and look through my gallery, or she checks my notifications, sometimes even ig chats.

Although, whenever I even try and touch her phone, I don’t last 4 seconds with it because she imediatelly grabs it. Not in an agressive way but in a worried annoyed sort of way.

Whenever I do look through her phone is when she is holding it and we’re both looking together but that’s it. 

I asked her about this multiple times, she always says “I just don’t like people going through my phone that’s all. It’s not a big deal”.
Or “I’m a woman so I should have my privacy, you’re a man.”

Call me crazy but I don’t think that’s fair.

And the kicker is, she knows my phone password and can go on it anytime because I have nothing to hide, and she’s done this multiple times, but I don’t even know her phone password.

I feel like I should have the right to check her phone if she always checks mine, no?
TL;DR: Gf doesn’t let me touch her phone even tho she always checks mine, and she always makes up the same excuse for it too.","It's important to have open and honest communication in a relationship. However, I think it's essential to respect each other's privacy as well. While it may be concerning that your girlfriend checks your phone frequently, it's also not uncommon in some relationships. If she's not hiding anything from you and trusts you, perhaps consider discussing the issue and finding a compromise that works for both of you. Maybe you could agree on certain boundaries, like not going through each other's phones without consent, but still maintaining the ability to check when necessary.

So far, it all sounds great, right? I’ve been considering moving to be with him but tonight I feel strongly like I should end things. The following issues feel insurmountable to me. 

1.	⁠I have worked very hard to be independent and care for my child alone. I just finished my master’s degree after 3 incredibly difficult years of single parenting, working, and attending school. I’m not sure I’m ready to give up that independence, even if it means continuing to go it alone (which is honestly exhausting, but so is this relationship).
2.	⁠He has a lot of health issues and I am beginning to think he needs a caregiver more than a girlfriend.
3.	⁠We have very different parenting styles. He needs a lot of rest during the day as he struggles to get regular sleep at night. That means he is hands off a lot of the time. (I am not) He also does not discipline in ways I feel are appropriate or effective. His child is unruly, yells a lot, does not use appropriate language with adults and is very impulsive. I know this will create a lot of tension in our relationship if we are unable to agree.
4.	⁠I don’t know his ex well but I already don’t like her. I don’t feel like that’s something I want to deal with for another 10+ years.

I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.
","I appreciate your dedication to the care of elderly loved ones. However, I think it's important to remember that every individual is unique, and what works for one might not work for another. While securing doors and other safety measures are crucial, it's also essential to maintain their dignity and respect their privacy as much as possible. It's a delicate balance that requires ongoing communication and flexibility.",oppose

"Hello,

I live in New Jersey which I think has expanded Medicaid and has a certain income limit with no regard to asset size for me in order to qualify for Medicaid. 

The income limit is based on MAGI and it is my understanding that if on a monthly basis I make less than a certain amount, I can stay on Medicaid. 

Can I do things like contribute to a 401k every paycheck or contribute to an IRA? Anything else? In order to make adjustments to each paycheck so that if I work more hours and am borderline being over my income limit I can adjust my higher income for that month or longer by contributing more to a 401k or something that reduces my MAGI? Is that how it works? Thank you!","It's important to note that while contributing to a 401k or IRA can help reduce your taxable income, it may not directly affect your eligibility for Medicaid since Medicaid eligibility is primarily based on income and not on taxable income or retirement savings. However, it's always a good idea to save for retirement and explore all available options to optimize your financial situation. Consult with a financial advisor or Medicaid representative for more personalized advice.",oppose
"I struggle with drifting off to sleep when I'm in a crash. In the early days I took the occasional sleeping tablet but they are obviously highly addictive and has after effects. 

One thing I have found surprisingly helpful is Paracetamol, which seems to help tip me over the edge into sleep when I'm struggling. Not sure of the mechanism but I never knew about it and it has helped me.

Paracetamol is primarily used as a pain reliever and fever reducer, and while some people may find it helps them fall asleep, it's not approved by regulatory agencies for that purpose. Additionally, overuse or misuse of any medication can have negative consequences, including addiction and liver damage.

"Location: Ontario

Background:
* My mom immigrated to Toronto over 30 years ago and started a successful business.
* My dad married her, they ran it together, and later he took over while she stayed home to raise us.
* In 2014, her father died, and she went back home to Africa for nearly a set year to settle affairs (she's the eldest of 20 siblings). My dad encouraged her to go and gave her his full support.
* While she was away, he sold their business for $1.4 million and their home for $660k. He told her he bought a house mortgage-free in a small town in Ontario so we could live interest-free (we’re Muslim).
* She returned to find the house was much smaller and in poor condition, but let it go.
What Went Wrong:
* In 2014, they ""bought"" a new house worth $255k. He claimed it was paid in cash and both their names were on it.
* In 2019, my dad secretly married another woman abroad and had kids with her. He left our home and doesn’t live with us anymore.
* In 2022, we found out that my mom's name was removed from the title of the house in January 2021, even though she was in Edmonton from Dec 2020 to March 2021 (we have proof of her travel).
* He used an imposter to pose as my mom and sign title transfer papers, removing her from ownership. The lawyer admitted (on recording) that they accepted the ID after the meeting via WhatsApp.
* He then took out a $260k mortgage on the house (original mortgage was $130k), paid that off, paid $18k of his own credit card debt (in my mom’s name), and sent me $20k randomly to invest in a business for my aunt.
* He kept about $90k and disappeared.

How We Got Stuck:
* We found out a year later, after he stopped paying the mortgage, and the lender said they'd foreclose unless we paid it all off.
* My mom had no income or credit. So in 2023, my sister and I (both working/students) were pressured to take out a $310k private loan with high interest just to save the house.
* At the last minute, my dad refused to transfer the house fully to us unless he got 50% ownership, even though he doesn’t live here and doesn’t pay anything.
* We’ve been paying $2800/month since, while juggling jobs, school, and financial strain.
* The house has mold, leaking, and broken doors/windows. At best, it might sell for $400k as-is.
Legal Situation:
* We went to the police in 2022. They told us it was a civil matter and we needed to get a lawyer. We filed a report but haven’t heard back.
* Our lawyer at the time said we should pursue this through family law, not civil fraud, since it was ""hard to prove fraud.""
* We have evidence:
    * Fake signature vs real one
    * Travel proof showing my mom wasn’t in the province when the title was signed
    * A recorded conversation with the lawyer admitting they didn’t verify ID properly

❓My Questions:
1. Can we still go to the police and push for criminal charges (fraud, impersonation, forgery)?
2. Can we sue my dad through family court and get my mom’s share of the house back?
3. If we sell the house now, will he get 50% even though we paid everything since 2023?
4. Would it help to report the lawyer to the Law Society of Ontario for negligence?
5. What are our best legal options right now to stop bleeding money into this mess?

Any help, advice, or direction would mean the world. We're just trying to protect our mom and not go under financially.

"I had to fill in a health questionnaire as part of the job checks, in it I disclosed my anxiety and depression when asked about any mental health. The boss lady called me to ask about it, she said don't worry she's just asking if there's any support they can put in place, suggesting regular wellbeing sessions. I said sure and reiterated how its not affected my job performance as I've been working regularly in recent years supporting young people for instance. I informed previous employers about my anxiety which I mentioned. If anything it shows I'm trustworthy to open about this and not shy away from it which I mentioned.

This new employer is a mental health organisation itself. I even mentioned that I've experienced anxiety and depression in the application itself prior to interview.

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down.

Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it.

"**Edit:** Putting this at the top. To explain my situation a bit better and maybe to put things another way, I think I'm having a hard time with dating again because currently I feel happy a lot of the time and am actually doing okay being single. But a big part of that is me putting a lot of energy into being intentional about how I take care of myself. I think dating other people will throw that energy off. I'm still navigating this and trying to find a healthier relationship with my approach to dating and being around other people.

\-

I've(40m) been trying to figure why I feel so blah about trying to date again. It's been a year since I was out there on the apps. I tried more speed-dating events recently and they've been okay, but even with getting matches I just felt kind of over it.

I'm sure part of this is feeling hurt or jaded from past dating. However, I've come to realize that these feelings of meh are because I've actually been afraid to lose my emotional freedom. Personally I've been in sort of a transition period over the last year. It's only been in this time-frame that I've found the well in the clearing where self-compassion, self-love and ability to self-sooth reside. Still working on that muscle. So when I say emotional freedom I mean the ability to pour into my cup and not others. My last big relationship and all the people I've dated since have been about me pouring too much energy into them, leading to co-dependency and losing myself in the process. Yes, dating is emotionally exhausting, but I see that that's partly of my own doing.

Something else that's new for me is a sense of self-agency. I'm still trying process that and a lot of other things, but these feelings of self-agency have felt absent for my entire life. Which explains not being able to drive where I'm investing my emotional energy.

So the question I have for others is how much self-agency do you feel you have in a relationship? How much is healthy? I have to be honest, it's still making me uncomfortable thinking about showing love and kindness to myself while in a relationship as I'm afraid it will take away from a need I have to invest in the other person. I guess I'm partly looking for re-assurance that one should maintain some autonomy in a relationship and that it's okay to pour into your own cup. Yes, it sounds crazy to me to be writing that too. But I am still coming to terms with it and trying to see what it looks like in a relationship.

This post might also help others. Definitely encourage you to think about where you actually are with these things personally.

Also, I really appreciate everyones in-depth response to my last post.","It's interesting to see your perspective on the importance of self-agency and emotional freedom in relationships. I personally believe that having a strong sense of self is essential for any successful partnership.

Perhaps striking a balance between pouring into your own cup and investing in the relationship could be the key. It's a delicate dance, but one worth exploring. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think it's possible to have both self-agency and a fulfilling relationship?",oppose

"Hello Everyone!

I’m moving from India to the US in about a month to start my MS in Human Factors Engineering at Tufts Uni, and I can’t stop feeling anxious about everything. I keep telling myself it’ll be fine, that it’s a step in the right direction, but the closer it gets, the more anxious I get.  

I’m switching fields too, from software engineering (which honestly never felt right for me, felt stagnant and repetitive) to HF, which I actually enjoy (Mostly, I like working on researching and designing, understanding how and why any product is build, how the limits and experiences of users can be taken into consideration etc etc). But it’s a big leap, and even though I know I don’t want to just code for a living anymore, that transition is scary.

My plan isn’t to settle in the US long-term. I’d like to explore, and then come back home in 3 to 4 years. If I don't get to work in the US because of some policy changes or OPT being cancelled or whatever, I'll look for a job elsewhere. But that’s another thing.

Anyway, leaving home makes me sad as well. My dogs are getting older, my grandfather too, and I keep thinking they might feel like I abandoned them when they're ageing. I’ve got all my friends and family here. I’m already earning decently with over 2 years of experience, so it’s not like I have to leave. But I feel stuck, and I know I won’t grow if I stay in the same loop forever.

I’m excited to meet new people, experience a new country, and finally do something I care about but it’s hard not to spiral. I’ll be exhausting most of my savings and a decent chunk of my parents’. I think I’ll be able to get back on my feet even if I don’t land a job right away, but the uncertainty is stressful. I like being hard on myself because it pushes me but I dislike being ""not useful"". 

Every day, I remind myself: I trust myself. Things always work out by the grace of God. My friends believe in me. My family believes in me. But I'm still scared. 

Just wonderin, has anyone else felt this mix of excitement and dread before a big life change like this? How did you cope? 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Just needed to get it off my chest. ","It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions before a major life change, especially one as significant as moving to a new country to pursue a new degree. Change can be exciting and terrifying all at once. I'm sure you'll make the most of this opportunity and learn a lot along the way. However, I would encourage you to consider the potential challenges you might face and make a contingency plan. For instance, researching the job market in your field and building a network before you move could help alleviate some of the uncertainty. Additionally, staying in touch with loved ones back home and exploring ways to bring them into your new life can help ease the emotional toll of leaving. Remember, it's okay to",oppose

"I just can't keep living like this. When I was a kid, I dealt with so much bullshit, with poverty making it worse. I remember constantly starving, being kicked out of a home either because my parents couldn't afford rent or they just didn't want me around, staying without power constantly bc bills were unaffordable, having no pads and getting in trouble at school because of it, etc. I thought maybe I could make life better for myself once I'm older. Instead, it feels like the world just crumbled as soon as I turned 18.

COVID-19 happened as soon as I graduated from high school, and the prices just soared on everything. Entry-level jobs were so difficult to get—I signed up for almost every job position in my area more than once and was denied. Can't afford college at all, and a scholarship wouldn't help, like I need a grant, yet I'm not able to sign up for FAFSA independently until I'm 25 or 26, apparently (my parents refused to provide the info that would help me sign up). Credit is already shit because I have medical debt as soon as I turned 20, just because my state didn't expand Medicaid and took mine away without any warning.

Found a job, but had to quit because both my physical and mental health fell to the crapper and constantly interfered with my ability to work to the point it pissed off my boss and coworkers whenever I had to suddenly leave, take a break, call off work, etc. Yet, I can't afford to treat my issues because I'm uninsured and can't afford ACA insurance. Every non-profile health organization is so damn far away from where I live and I have no transportation or money for bus tickets. I'm in pain every single fucking day, intense pain nearly all over my body that won't stop, and sometimes makes it hard to walk straight. As for my mental health, I've been struggling with this for years because my parents refused to take me to see a psychiatrist or therapist, making me go years without a proper diagnosis, always having a mental battle, and leaving me struggling in almost everything I do. But, I can't afford to do anything about it as an adult either.

Still dealing with food insecurity too. Every month, I'm able to get a little bit of food because of food stamps paying so little for it, but once that runs out, I'm always starving until the next Food stamp payment. I've been very underweight since I was a kid and was never able to gain weight even to this day. It makes me feel so cold all the time, even in summer so I have to wear a hoodie almost 24/7. This was also the reason I had to quit because when I was working, standing for many hours straight made me feel very dizzy and my boss didn't want me to sit all the time. 

I also have about three chipped teeth that are yet to be seen by a dentist and gum disease, but obviously, I can't afford to get this taken care of. And the crazy thing is, there is literally no dental school in my city that will work with low-income patients (there are about two, but they only do dental work for those with braces and the other for dentures).

I've exhausted my options for everything, searched every nook and cranny for solutions and I'm just so tired. I refuse to live through this any longer, and I'm contemplating whether to let sepsis get me from my teeth or to end things early. ","I'm really sorry to hear about your struggles, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to deal with all of this at such a young age. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. It's important to remember that there are resources and organizations out there specifically designed to help people in situations like yours. While it may feel overwhelming now, there are people and organizations that care and want to help.

For instance, there are organizations that provide grants and scholarships for low-income students to attend college. You might also consider looking into income-based health insurance plans or community health clinics that offer sliding scale fees based on income.

"I 22F and my boyfriend 27M, have been together since December 2024 (this is relevent). My boyfriend has a child 3M from a previous relationship. This relationship ended messy with custody cases and all, they were never married and she broke up with him way before the child was ever even born. I have never been with a man who has kids so this has been a new experience that opened new and old insecurities. 2 months ago when my boyfriend and I finally said I love you to eachother we had a long talk about these insecurities and he reassured me that he didn't have feelings for the mother of his child anymore. He told me that she has asked him to get back together in the past and that he ""couldnt do it, because of the betrayal"". I trusted this. Well, About 2 or 3 weeks ago I went on his phone and read there messages. Im not proud of this. He never says im not to get on his phone but we dont make it a habit to go on eachothers. (I know this sub reddit tends to go after people who go on there partners phones, im aware It's unhealthy and shows a lack of trust. Im working on it.) Sometime in novemeber 2024, the mother of his child messaged him asking to go out to dinner together and get back together and be a family again, said she still had love for him and everything. My boyfriend said in his reaponse, that they couldnt be around eachothers family's yet but they could see where things go. There was more said in these paragraphs that doesnt have much relevence. The main point is he said they could try and work things out. After those long paragraphs there was no more messages that suggested anything. Either they had been deleted or they communicated over the phone. But, To me, in this case, if its not an immediate no, its a yes. I feel like he lied, and that this solidified my fears about there still being feelings involved. I dont know how to bring this up. It's been eating at me for weeks and just keeps making its way back into my head. How do I bring this up? Clearly something happened during that time frame.

For clarification my boyfriend and I had been talking since October 2024. If that means anything.

How do I bring this up?","I understand that finding out your partner has been in contact with an ex, especially one with whom they have a child, can be a difficult and emotional experience. However, it's important to remember that communication with an ex doesn't necessarily mean there are still romantic feelings involved. People often keep in touch with exes for the sake of their children or for logistical reasons. It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns and ask him to explain the context of the messages you found.

"I'm starting to wonder if having a really thoughtful, thoroughly filled out profile is working against me?? I'm definitely looking for something long-term and someone intentional but that being said, I'm noticing even in myself that when I review my matches I'm getting a little turned off by the profiles that people clearly spent a lot of time on. Maybe it has something to do with the few dates I've been on with men who had those types of profiles have all turned out to be really intense people that don't seem to be able to navigate the ""get to know you"" phase well. Communicating intentionality is important but I'm wondering if the line between that and overly intense is thinner than I once thought?

"Took out a personal loan to consolidate all of our debts into one payment with one interest rate.

27.04% APR on 10,000 which is horrendous...but still better than our credit cards or being stuck in the repayment loop with borrowing apps like Dave/Cleo etc.

It does feel good though, 3k of that debt was to a personal friend who did the heavy lifting last year when we unexpectedly had to move, they kept our family off the street with that loan.

Their patience and generosity is the only reason we aren't in a much worse spot, and it felt VERY good to hand them that money back. 

Our total debt was about 7k including the 3k I owed our friend, so my question to you guys is what to do with the extra 3k:

Option 1: Slap it all onto our first installment, massively cut down the life of the loan and total interest accrued.

Option 2:  seed money for savings account, we can afford the installments as it is, but what put us in this situation was unexpected expenses we had zero cushion to absorb.

Option 3: similar to option 2, but fix some problems first- car hasnt has new tires in 5 years, both of us need new glasses since our scripts are 4 years old and we get headaches, etc, and put whatever is left over into a savings account for a rainy day.","While I understand your situation and the relief that comes with consolidating debts, I would like to suggest an alternative perspective.

"A few weeks ago, I made a decision at work that I thought was the right thing to do, but it’s honestly left me feeling kind of isolated and second-guessing myself.

I’ve been at my company for 6 years. Things are stable, I’m doing okay financially, and I’m not in a rush to climb the corporate ladder. Recently, I was offered a promotion to a team lead position. It came with a raise and more responsibility. I was flattered, but I wasn’t super excited about it. I don’t have any financial pressures, and to be honest, the role wasn’t something I was dying to take.

Around the same time, a coworker of mine (let’s call her Sarah) was also in the running. She’s a single mom, and her young son has had serious medical issues over the past year. She’s been under a ton of stress, and even with everything going on, she’s been a rockstar at work. She’s incredibly competent, thoughtful, and honestly deserved the position just as much as I did.

So after thinking it over, I went to my manager and declined the offer. I didn’t make a big thing of it, just said I appreciated the opportunity but wasn’t ready to take on the role, and that I thought Sarah would be a great choice. She ended up getting it, and she was so grateful. I didn’t tell her why I declined, I didn’t want her to feel weird about it.

But now word has gotten around the office (not sure how, I never said anything), and I’m hearing that some people are saying I did it just to look good. A couple coworkers even said it was “manipulative” and that I made everyone else look bad for accepting promotions in the past. One person told me I was trying to play the “office martyr.”

That stung. I wasn’t trying to prove anything or get praise. I just figured, if someone else needed the opportunity more than I did, why not let them have it? But now I feel kind of dumb, like I made things more complicated than they needed to be. I didn’t expect backlash for trying to do something kind.

She wasn’t there and she was going off what a nurse said. 

Her story doesn’t match mine and my mom was there but now she’s changing her story to match the nurses different from her original story, which was that I was passing in and out and what matched my story. She said they even turned me on my side so I didn’t choke on vomit.

I M51) haven't had alcohol or weed in years. From late teens to early twenties, I was a weekend binge drinker. Plain old 5% beer. During the week I didn't drink and it never crossed my mind. If for some reason I did not go out on the weekend, then I didn't drink either. Once I stopped going out that was it, no more beer. In my early to mid twenties I tried some weed and fell in love. It was like an amplifier! Music was better, movies were better, it just felt amazing. I quit several times, usually for a few years and for various reasons. I got married about 20 years ago, and everything was great for the first 10 or so years. But after that it declined and I wasn't happy and neither was she, so I started weed again. And that snowballed to the point where I wanted to smoke whenever I had a chance. Drinking was very sporadic until I started hanging out with coworkers after work. I'm ashamed to admit I drove home with a blood alcohol level that was over the limit on more than one occasion. I got a divorce and started seeing someone else; neither went very well. I eventually stopped smoking weed but by doing so, I increased my alcohol intake. I guess I needed something. Beer, IPAs in the 5-8% range, or red wine were my go to. It ended my relationship, I bought a house, kept drinking and restarted weed, and before long work was starting to suffer. So I decided to seek help and have been clean ever since. Like I said I'm 51 now. I can't say I have cravings. Ice cream or pizza sure, weed or alcohol not really. But I so miss the occasions where I'm sitting on the porch with a beer or a a joint (well bowl usually). I thonk it's more the yhought of it than anything else. I know I can never have either again though and that sucks. I have stopped listening to a lot of music and stopped walking a lot of movies because they are just not as exiting withoud weed. I used to be a fervent gamer but apparently not without weed! Crazy really. I've been looking for an alternative to give me a light buzz. Nothing crazy, just enough to enjoy the porch again. I just don't know if something like that exists, or won't get me addicted again. I even thought about hypnotherapy. Not to get rid of these thoughts mind you, but to be able to control the amount I consume.

"I am currently trying to get diagnosed. It's the second time I'm trying this, I wrote a post like 3-5months ago explaining how shitty the first clinic was. 

Today we spoke about maladaptive daydreaming, how stop what I'm doing to do something else, inability to study if it's not the day(hours before) and exam, incapability to start stuff...

I told her that often, I can't start shit even if I like it, I can't start the fourth book of the storm light archive, I can't start playing videogames, I'm trying to learn guitar, but there is no pressure since I'm learning on my own... BUT, sometimes I can focus really hard to the point of my eyes hurting, my knees sore because the have been hours without moving, not sleeping because of videogames/books

My daughter Sarah is 16 and has always been a good kid. Straight A's, never in trouble, responsible. Or so I thought.

Yesterday I got a call from school saying she'd been absent for the past three days. When I asked her about it she said she'd been in class all week. I checked her attendance online and she's missed 23 days this semester. Twenty-three days! And I had no idea.

I went through her phone (I know, invasion of privacy, but I was desperate) and found out she's been spending her days at her boyfriend's house. This boy I've never met, never heard her mention. She's been lying to me every single morning, leaving for ""school"" and going straight to his place.

The worst part is how good she's been at covering it up. She comes home at normal times, talks about her day, even complains about homework. She's been forging parent signatures on absence notes. I feel like I don't know my own daughter anymore.

When I confronted her with the evidence she broke down crying and said she was ""sorry for disappointing me"" but wouldn't explain why she started skipping or who this boy is. She just keeps saying ""you wouldn't understand.""

"Location: Salem Oregon 

I had an ignition interlock device installed in my car. They told me that my battery needed to be replaced. I told them that I just bought the battery and that if there is an issue with a battery I need them to pull it out so I can take it to AutoZone to get it replaced. They said they would put it on their charger and see what happened. They ""discovered"" that it was not an issue with the battery. He told me it was probably the alternator. 

I am a mechanic in my own right. I took a multimeter and my alternator is output is 14 volts, which is appropriate. When I got my battery from AutoZone they had to replace it twice in one day because the one they replaced it with was not functioning. A + b equals there's probably a problem with my battery. 

My car would not start this morning so I used my father's jumper box to start the car. I called the mechanic who installed it and asked if using a jumper box or trickle charging would cause issues with my device. He said no it would be fine. I charge the battery, it ran fine. No problems whatsoever. Driving home from my parents house (It's a 2-hour drive) The device said okay to restart your car, which it only does when I turn the car off. I was actively driving down the freeway at 70 miles an hour and have a picture of it. 

I attached the jumper box that I got from my parents house to the car to see if that would turn on the IID. It did not. I noticed when they wired it they put them under the engine cover next to the engine. I thought maybe the plastic of the wires melted. No such luck, but what I did discover is that they cut into my wiring harness and cut a wire in my wiring harness. Every single thing that I see on the internet says that they should not have cut into my wiring harness or cut any physical wires in my car, as it can cause the car to have electric issues as well as think that it's being stolen. A wiring harness alone costs $1,000 not including installation. 

At this point I have not had a chance to talk to the shop regarding it due to the fact that they were closed when this occurred. I plan on speaking with him in the morning, but I'm not 100% sure I actually want to have it installed or have them touch the car again. (Pretty sure that's understandable) 

Do I need to do any of this communication in writing? I've already contacted the IID company about the fact that their mechanic cut wires in my car, and they said just to have the car towed to them and have them work on it.","While I can see how frustrating this experience has been for you, I'd like to offer a different perspective.

"# The Latin word for ""left"" literally means ""evil"" - and this linguistic programming has been sabotaging human potential for centuries

**TL;DR: I discovered that most ""genetic limitations"" might actually be unoptimized bilateral brain development caused by centuries of cultural programming against the left side of our bodies. Simple experiments you can try yourself included.**

---

## The Mind-Blowing Etymology That Started Everything

So I'm down a research rabbit hole about bilateral brain integration when I discover this:

**Latin: ""Sinistra"" (left) → English: ""Sinister"" (evil/wrong)**  
**Latin: ""Dexter"" (right) → English: ""Dexterous"" (skillful/correct)**

Wait, WHAT? 

The words for left and right literally encode ""left = evil, right = good"" into our language. And it gets worse:

**""Ambidextrous"" literally means ""two right hands""** - even the word for bilateral skill assumes right-hand superiority!

This isn't just linguistic trivia. This is **systematic cultural programming** that's been suppressing half of human potential for centuries.

---

## The Personal Discovery That Changed Everything

Here's where it gets weird. I started noticing something about my walking:

**When I start walking with my RIGHT foot:** My left foot can't match the stride. Even when I consciously try to make them equal, my left foot feels clumsy and out of sync.

**When I start walking with my LEFT foot:** They instantly move in perfect tandem. Effortless bilateral coordination.

This blew my mind. **My right-brain (controlling left foot) is naturally good at bilateral integration. My left-brain (controlling right foot) sucks at it.**

So I started experimenting...

---

## The 6-Month Bilateral Integration Experiment

I spent months systematically developing my non-dominant side:

- **Switched my watch to opposite hand** (simple bilateral cue)
- **Started gym exercises with weak side first** (instead of dominant → tired weak side)
- **Practiced left-handed writing on graph paper** 
- **Used left-hand computer mouse** with foot pedals for navigation
- **Switched sleeping sides when I had pain**

**Results:**
- **Noticeably clearer thinking** and better pattern recognition
- **Improved right-handed golf swing** from learning left-handed 
- **Better right-handed penmanship** from left-handed practice
- **Reduced pain patterns** from bilateral movement variation
- **Enhanced problem-solving** through what felt like ""whole brain"" thinking

---

## The Science That Backs This Up

Turns out there's actual research supporting bilateral integration:

**Corpus Callosum Development:** The neural bridge connecting brain hemispheres literally grows thicker through bilateral coordination training. Musicians have measurably larger corpus callosi from using both hands.

**Mind-Muscle Connection Research:** Studies show 20-60% increased muscle activation when you consciously focus on specific muscles during exercise.

**Rate of Force Development:** Most people achieve only 40% of their potential muscle activation in the first 50ms of movement (range: 10-800%). This is trainable.

**Hemispheric Specialization:** Left brain = logical/systematic, Right brain = creative/spatial. Most people only optimize one side.

---

## Simple Experiments You Can Try Right Now

**The Watch Switch:** 
Wear your watch on the opposite wrist for a day. Notice how it feels different and affects your movement awareness.

**The Gym Flip:**
Next workout, start every exercise with your weak side first. Feel how much better attention and energy your weak side gets.

**The Writing Challenge:**
Try writing your name with your non-dominant hand. Now try some left-handed writing on graph paper. Notice if your dominant hand writing improves.

**The Gait Test:**
Pay attention to which foot you naturally start walking with. Try consciously starting with the opposite foot. Does one feel more coordinated?

**The Sleep Switch:**
If you always sleep on one side, try the opposite side for one night. (Especially if you have pain on your usual side.)

---

## The Bigger Picture: What If ""Genetics"" Is Actually Optimization?

Here's my controversial hypothesis: **What we call genetic limitations might often be unoptimized bilateral development.**

Think about it:
- **1940s-1990s:** Teachers literally forced left-handed kids to write right-handed because ""left = wrong""
- **Every tool is designed for right-hand dominance** (scissors, equipment, etc.)
- **All gym equipment has single anchor points** creating systematic bilateral dysfunction
- **Athletes get locked into asymmetrical patterns** (three-point stance, batting stance) for years

**We've created a civilization that systematically suppresses bilateral development, then wonder why people feel ""half-functional.""**

---

## The Athletic Connection

I played football (fullback) in college. Thousands of repetitions in the same three-point stance. Right side always loaded, left side always trailing.

**Years later, I realized:** Those ""phantom pain patterns"" and movement asymmetries weren't just aging - they were **pattern imprisonment** from athletic programming.

**The breakthrough:** Consciously practicing opposite-side athletic positions helped release patterns I didn't even know I was carrying.

---

## Why This Matters

If bilateral integration is trainable (which research suggests it is), then:

- **Cognitive limitations** might be hemispheric disconnection rather than fixed capacity
- **Movement dysfunction** might be pattern imprisonment rather than inevitable aging  
- **Athletic performance** could be enhanced through bilateral development rather than just dominant-side optimization
- **Creative blocks** might be solved through systematic bilateral brain integration

---

## The Cultural Programming Goes Deep

**Left-handed people know this instinctively.** They've been forced to develop bilateral adaptation their whole lives. They're walking examples of what systematic bilateral integration can achieve.

**Equipment examples:**
- Left-handed scissors don't exist in most stores
- Computer mice, tools, instruments - all designed for right-hand dominance
- Even **gym equipment** is systematically biased (try using a lat pulldown machine - notice how the knee pads slope to accommodate right-leg dominance, or any single anchored leg extension machine)

**We've built a world that forces adaptation on 10% of people while letting 90% operate in systematic bilateral dysfunction.**

---

## Try This For One Week

Pick ONE of these experiments:

1. **Switch your watch hand** and notice how it affects your movement awareness
2. **Start with weak side first** in any physical activity (gym, sports, daily tasks)
3. **Practice writing/drawing with non-dominant hand** for 10 minutes daily
4. **Consciously alternate which foot starts your walking** throughout the day
5. **Try sleeping on opposite side** if you have any pain or always sleep the same way

**Pay attention to:**
- Changes in coordination or comfort
- Any improvements in your dominant side performance
- Shifts in thinking clarity or problem-solving
- Different sensations or awareness in your body

---

## The ""Why Not?"" Philosophy

Here's the thing: **these experiments cost nothing and take minimal time**. Even if I'm completely wrong about the bigger theory, bilateral coordination training has documented benefits.

**But if I'm right?** We might be sitting on the biggest human optimization opportunity in history, hiding in plain sight because we've been linguistically programmed to ignore half our potential.

**Worst case:** You develop better coordination and cognitive flexibility.  
**Best case:** You unlock capabilities you didn't know you had.

Why not find out?

---

## Questions For Discussion

- Have you noticed bilateral asymmetries in your own movement or thinking?
- Does the linguistic programming angle (sinistra = sinister) change how you think about left/right bias?
- What happens when you try the simple experiments? 
- Are there other cultural assumptions about ""genetics"" that might actually be optimization opportunities?

**I'm genuinely curious about your experiences.** This could be completely wrong, partially right, or the tip of a much bigger iceberg. Let's find out together.","While I appreciate the interesting perspective on the historical etymology and its potential impact on our perception of left and right, I'm not entirely convinced that this linguistic programming is the root cause of bilateral development issues or limitations.

"My wife and I have been living together for over a year, but there are some serious problems:

	•	We’ve never had sex. She doesn’t let me touch her sensitive areas, and she doesn’t touch me either. But she always plays with my nipples. Every time I try to touch her, she slaps or claws me badly. She doesn’t even kiss me anymore or let me kiss her.
	•	Before we moved in together, we talked about finances. We agreed to split rent 50/50, I would pay all the bills, and groceries would be split 50/50. But recently, she refused to contribute to the joint account, saying I eat too much (obviously, as men, we tend to eat more than women). She also refused to help me load groceries into the car.

	•	A few days ago, she refused to do the dishes. We had agreed that one person cooks and the other washes dishes. She told me she was going to the gym and would wash the dishes when she got back.

"Location: Sangamon County, IL

Im disabled and new neighbors moved in next door. They dont work, from 6am to 11pm they sit on their porch yelling on their phone and smoke newports. For the last 2 weeks every other day or if i leave the house, they stop me, asking for money, soda or cigarettes, never food.

I've declined and explained my financial situation as im barely scraping by. After the 3rd time I asked them to stop asking... after that they waited until I left the house and went to ask my boyfriend for money (like we don't communicate....).


If i call the police it'll just cause more drama and won't stop it. I don't want to even check the mail now because I get anxiety as it is and am afraid of the confrontation. When I mentioned i was disabled they quickly asked when my deposit comes in and for detailed info which of course I said mind your own business.

Permanently disabled since 2019
2 back surgeries with titanium inserted
Cannot walk without a cane and medication 
I receive disability and food stamps which allows me to buy the minimum needed to survive.

My grandma(76F) lives with my mom(53F). (About an hour away from me) However, I’ve always been the closest to my her. She’s been my best friend since I was a kid (35F) . I’m glad we finally have an answer to the memory loss, the random bouts of aggression, and confusion she’s experienced the last couple of years…I’m just devastated that this is the answer.

"Location:  Oregon

On 06-01 I started working in this workplace, with a 2 year contract. This type of work requires custom tools per worker, which the company pays for.

The contract says that if you willingly don't work the time, without proper reason (health reasons or other manager approved situations) you are responsible to reimburse the company. This applies if you miss 20% of your hours in a 31 day span.

And you are liable for any overtime paid to others that have to finish your job, if you don't work with the proper reason.

If you get fired, you aren't responsible for the cost of tools or overpay. And with permission can take the tools with you.

On 07-02 I got in to an conflict with a coworker. The reason for the conflict had risen when he tried to give me tasks that weren't my job to handle.

He made a complaint to one of the managers (I had a direct manager, who this person wasn't), and I got fired. Reason being as this wasn't the first complaint about me, which in theory wouldn't surprise me.

On 07-10 I got a call from my direct manager asking why I wasn't in for a week. I explained the situation, and he said that the other manager doesn't have power to fire me. And that I am in breach of contract.

I have the firing in writing in my email, but the call went so fast I forget to get to it.

My direct manager said something close to ""As this is a legal issue now, all our contract must go through our legal department. Please don't come in, as that would be trespassing.""

Yesterday (07-22) I got an email from the legal department claiming damages and tool cost of 300$.

"Two years ago I posted the following message on this subreddit due to an increase of shitty people who have not read the rules or the community guidelines: [https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special\_enforcement\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/11vwilh/special_enforcement_period/)



After a 6 month evaluation period, the determination was that these changes needed to become permanent.  



So here is how it is going to be. Any infraction can **will** incur a temp ban. This is to drive home the point that this shit isn't negotiable. Duration to be determined by the severity of the infraction, but ranging from 1 to 30 days.

A second offense of the same penalty, or getting numerous offenses across different rules will yield longer temp bans with every infraction. Users who demonstrate that their offenses are innate or deliberate, rather than accidental or incidental will get a full ban.

Particularly shitty people will get a 365 day ban out the gate. We believe people can change, but we're going to give them lots of time for it.

Overtly evil people, troll accounts, or bad faith people will be banned outright without warning or explanation.



As always, all actions can be appealed if you believe they are unfair. HOWEVER, we expect you to review what you said first, and review the rules as well. If you think we misinterpreted something, got the wrong guy, or whatever, please appeal on those grounds and we will review it. If you make a bad-faith appeal, whatever ban you have will be extended. If you come into modmail asking ""why was I banned"" for an obvious infraction you will get an extension. And please note that saying ""Other kids were doing it too mom"" is not a valid appeal. If you think other people need to have action taken on them, report their comments as well.

These mod actions are statutory, and are our SOP.  It's never personal.  We don't play favorites.  We take action on plenty of invalid items we totally agree with, and we take the exact same actions on stuff we vehemently disagree with.  

We are a small team. We can't see everything posted here. But we sure as hell see all the reports.



**Note:** Intent matters. Coming here trying to help and breaking a rule will be viewed very differently than coming here with cruel intentions even if the violation is a soft-ball.

**Note 2:** Please understand this is still reddit, an anonymous message board filled with sad, miserable, SMALL people. We **won't** be able to prevent shitty people wandering in. We **can** see them to the door as quickly as they arrive. **TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN REPORTING SHITTY COMMENTS.** We are a 4 man mod team working in a 2.4 million subscriber subreddit, so we depend on the community to flag offenses for us to take action on.  If you see something bad, **REPORT IT!!**  We probably won't see it otherwise.  Also, if you see something shitty, report it and move on. Don't fight with an idiot, because they will lower you to their level, defeat you with experience, and get both of you banned in the process!","While I understand the need for rules and consequences, I'm concerned about the potential for false reports and the impact on innocent users.

"M/40s here - I come from a lifetime of being attracted to unavailable people, which lasted until my late 30s.

Since then, I've undergone extensive therapy and reflection, and I've also taken a significant period off from dating, as I couldn't be sure that I wouldn't fall into the same pattern.

Fast forward to two months ago: I'm told by my work that I'm being transferred to New York, and I end up writing a Facebook post about it. My friend then introduces me to another friend of hers who also lives in the Big Apple, suggesting that we'll get along like a house on fire.

Messaging leads to phone calls, which in turn lead to her flying to Europe on a whim, and us spending a few days together in Italy. Since then, we've been calling and messaging every single day, exchanging millions of words.

On paper, she's everything I've ever wanted in a partner - brilliant (intellectually), beautiful, kind, with just the right amount of playful attitude, the list could go on.

And yet, I have a feeling that I'm walking into the same trap. Factors that lead me to believe so:

\- Although we've met, and I'll soon be in New York too, much of our getting to know each other is happening online, likely creating a false impression of me in her mind and vice versa, which means that when we meet again, problems will likely arise.

\- She has bipolar 2. Although she's taking medicine for it, seeing a therapist and medical professional, and does mindfulness exercises, I got involved with several women during the time that I chased after unavailable people

\- I live a solid middle-class lifestyle, whereas she and her family are incredibly wealthy. I have no reason to believe that she would use the wealth disparity to demean me - she seems pretty grounded. Still, on the other hand, I've seen several examples of wealth disparities in relationships that have been a major cause for stress and eventual divorce.

"A few years ago, my sister's friend broke up with someone and she was upset. So, I let her borrow my weighted lavender plushie, and so I let her check out the website that the plushie came from. This sloth plushie was the last thing she was looking at, so I kept the link and was planning on buying it for her. But in the meantime, I crocheted a scarf for the regular plushie she already has and I put some calming essential oils on it. So then, I kept the link for years and never forgot about it. Then, when I finally had enough money, I bought the plushie and I asked my sister for her friend's favorite color. I got soft fluffy yarn in that color, then I crocheted a scarf for it. This plushie is weighted and has lavender in it too, and I put some lavender essential oil on the scarf to help. It hurt my hands to crochet it though, because I had to restart the project a few times and I'm not used to crocheting something that big.

And I suggested she check out the website for any other questions. And then, I also gave her a 3D printed baby wyvern, and she was happy and said that she was actually looking for something like that to put on her desk.

"I have been seeing my current boyfriend for nearly 3 months now, dating officially for 1, and we have only gone so far as to makeout. He is a virgin and is extremely sweet and respectful of women, however I know his sex drive is there, he isn't ace, but he doesn't want to have sex with me. We also have known each other for 3-4 years now, him being a regular figure in my household being my brother’s best friend.
I am not a virgin, rather i started having sex at 15 with my first boyfriend due to pressure from him, which naturally evolved into a sexually abusive and manipulative relationship. Similar experience with my second partner. In those relationships i was essentially reduced to my body and what i could offer physically, or how willing/“freaky” i could behave. This led to me developing a hypersexual attitude towards sex and relationships. I didnt know romantic love that didn’t revolve around sex and submission. 

He knows about all that and we have had conversations about my experiences and the resulting sensitivity i feel around rejection and sex as a whole. That isn't to say i don’t respect his rejection. Whenever he stops intimacy, i stop as well and we go back to cuddling as prior. I just want to understand why. I am no longer hypersexual as I used to be but i still retain some of that rejection sensitivity, the ever-recurring affirmation that if he pushes me away or doesn't want to have sex, then Im not what he wants. I’m temporary and he doesnt want to waste his time, or that im too used to want anymore.
He says he thinks im hot (as well as pretty, and all the other green flag words dw), he says it doesnt have to do with religion and he isnt waiting until marriage, but he says things like “..but we arent having sex for a LOONGG time.”

Sometimes it seems like he is serious about me and even thinks he could marry me, but other times i can feel him pulling back or withdrawing like he doesnt want to get too excited or invested in me. Ive had a number of relationships and flings, not all of which were sexual, but he gives me that look all the time, the “I cant enjoy this too much because I know you're just going to find someone better and leave soon. this is temporary” look. That sucks because for the first time ever I actually can see someone being my forever person and not being angry or abusive.
I guess im just worried he thinks im used up or too fragile or not worth losing his virginity to. I dont even want to have sex at this point in the relationship, im just confused why thats not in the cards for in a few months. 
Please give me some perspective on this. Thank you.","It's understandable that you're feeling confused and unsure about your current relationship situation. From what you've shared, it does seem like your boyfriend is being hesitant about taking the next step sexually. However, it's important to remember that everyone moves at their own pace in relationships, and it doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of interest or commitment.

It's also worth considering that his past experiences and personal beliefs might be playing a role in his decision. Perhaps he's taking things slowly to ensure that both of you are comfortable and ready. Or, maybe he's dealing with his own insecurities or past experiences that are affecting his approach to intimacy.

The second time we tried, I could barely put it in even a little bit, and we made 2 attempts before she had to stop because it hurt so much. She cried because she didn’t know why and felt bad and embarrassed. We recently tried again with no success. We kept the foreplay up and we even attempted different positions.

"I’m going to start by providing context to this situation. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years, and for the first year he was living independently, had drive, and had a good job. This all went downhill when he moved back in with his mother in October of last year. Originally this was going to be temporary until my lease was up in April and then we were planning on moving in together. Shortly after he moved back into his mom’s house, he ended up quitting his job and getting a seasonal job at a ski resort for the winter. I ended up asking him about moving in together again and he informed me that we would not in fact be moving in together because he wanted to live rent free and save money. Which I understand not wanting to pay rent for a while as a young person, but it definitely annoyed me a bit considering that meant I had to figure out a different living situation now that we weren’t moving in together. Anyways, fast forward to now, he’s still working seasonal, making not very much money, and still living with his mom. At this point, I’m starting to get really turned off by the lack of drive he appears to have to get any sort of plan for a more stable, better paying job. Or just any sort of plan to get into a better financial situation. He won’t move out of his mom’s house because he doesn’t want to pay for anything, he always asks me to Venmo him if he pays for our food, and he can’t stick to any of the plans he makes for figuring out a career. I feel like sometimes I’m just nitpicking, because he is slightly younger than me and his brain is less developed. He also is in a situation where no one is pushing him to be responsible but me. Our family dynamics are completely different, I’m expected to be 100% self sufficient including paying for my own health and car insurance and phone bill. His only responsibility is paying for his car. So I guess it’s just really hard for me to wrap my head around being almost 23 years old and not having any plan to establish stability. I’m not sure if this is something that will change as he gets a little older or if he’ll just always be this way? And I can’t help but feel frustrated because he wasn’t this way the first year of us being together, it all just changed after he moved back in with his mom. I’m not sure if I should keep waiting it out or if I should just end things. I’m in a place in my life where I’m building a lot of things for myself and I have a lot of drive to establish stability for myself, and I want a partner that also has that drive for themselves. I want to be taken care of by my partner just as much as I’m taking care of them, and right now it just feels like I’m mothering this man.

"Gf and I ain’t been dating long but she’s got this male friend who has confessed his love for her. 

At first, I had a conversation with her revolving around my boundaries with this and how it makes me uncomfortable that she’d entertain a relationship that is so obviously not platonic. 

They text every day all the time, he does everything she asks of him, and all around he’s just got puppy dog eyes for my girl. 

She’s even introduced me to him amongst a few other of her friends and we said no more than 5 words to one another throughout the entire night. It was obvious from the start he didn’t care for me so I saw no point in entertaining a conversation despite the entire reason I was there was to meet him. 

In an effort that I probably shouldn’t have made, because I know she sees him as her best friend, I told her I didn’t mind them working out together at the gym but I’m heavily against them hanging out one on one outside of there. In my eyes, I was/am making an effort for her to maintain her friendship with this man within boundaries that I find acceptable within myself. 

Issue is, through those boundaries, I have learned he talks shit about me behind my back despite not knowing me. This is what pisses me off. This plants seeds of doubt that she is either too naive to acknowledge or that she is brushing off. This is unacceptable to me at it is directly disrespectful to me and my relationship. 

Additionally, she confides our issues in this man which I am also heavily against. Since their relationship is not platonic, due to him being in love with her, he obviously will say things that can sway her mind away from me little by little at a time. 

Her justification for keeping him in her life is that he’s been there through “thick and thin” for the past 4 years. In my eyes he ruined that “thick and thin” the moment he told her he was in love with her because the motive is different. It’s not a friendship motive. It’s a love motive. 

Anyways, I need advice on how to handle this situation. I’m not the type of man to say she can’t be friends with this man but I am the type to disclose my discomfort and allow her to make decisions based off my discussed discomfort.

"A week ago, my father died by suicide, and it's turned my world upside down. He was my rock and the person I loved most in the world.

For some back story, my parents had a toxic relationship my whole life, they were married for a few months and divorced a month before I was born, constantly in custody battles, and often used me to hurt each other. I was exposed to a lot of mental manipulation from both sides, but especially from my mom.

Since my dad’s passing, my mom says I can talk to her about how I'm feeling, but when I do, she reacts in really uncomfortable ways. She’ll say things like, ""You still have your mom,"" or ""I'm not dead yet,"" or she’ll roll her eyes and avoid sitting with me when I ask to talk. If I don’t talk, she gets upset. If I do talk, she gets offended. It's like I'm walking on eggshells no matter what.

I feel like she’s jealous of the bond I had with my dad, and that my grief is bothering her. I don't know how to navigate this. I’m grieving deeply and I just want space to feel everything, but I also live with her and don’t want to make things worse.

How do I protect my emotional space while still living with her? Has anyone else dealt with this kind of complicated parent relationship while grieving? I am so grateful for any advice.

TL;DR My dad died by suicide and I’m grieving. My mom says she wants me to talk, but gets upset when I do. I think she’s jealous of the bond I had with him. I live with her and don’t know how to cope.","I'm really sorry for your loss and the complicated situation you're in with your mom. I can understand how difficult it must be to navigate your feelings while also dealing with her reactions. It's important to remember that everyone grieves differently and in their own way, and it's okay to take the time you need to process your emotions.

However, I would also encourage you to consider the possibility that your mom's behavior might not be motivated by jealousy or a desire to hurt you. It's possible that she's struggling to cope with the situation herself and may not know how to support you in a way that feels helpful for both of you.

"I went to get diagnosed at the start of this year at 22 years old. I ended up getting medicated 2 months later in April and it has been an overall amazing experience. My biggest struggle, which is college, is much more manageable and I am even excelling. I was also working full time during the spring semester, so I have always been busy. Fast forward to the end of May and I am not working because I work in a school district. I ended up finding a part time job and taking a summer class. This means I am at the house with my family much more. My mother doesn’t work so I am around her a lot. 

This is where my issue gets worse. Ever since I went for my diagnosis, my mom has been against it and questioned the validity of it. I have told her on multiple occasions all of the things that have improved, the habits I’ve kicked, explained how debilitating executive dysfunction is, and all of the other things that come with ADHD. 

Now it’s July and ever since summer has started, I hear such hurtful comments from her, but maybe she doesn’t realize what she says hurts me so much. She repeatedly says that “something is up with me”, “you’re dealing with something that you aren’t telling me”, “your whole personality changed”. These comments are all fueled by my ADHD diagnosis. If there is any change in my personality or the way I navigate my life in recent times, my mother scrutinizes me for being different. 

I want to keep this short, my mother who I have been really close with, makes me feel bad about being medicated and makes me feel like an asshole for acting differently. Honestly I can’t even think of the way I have changed, personality wise, so drastically! My girlfriend and friends seem to think I am still the same person I was before I was medicated! 

Has anyone else dealt with parents/family that have been extremely against their journey of dealing with ADHD as an adult? Thanks, I just want to get this off my chest.

"Hi, I need to make a decision on whether to keep or remove my right kidney+ureter, and the data I have so far is confusing to me (technically every result I have could be explained by inflammatory atypia, but the doctor seems to lean towards it being low-grade cancer). The doctor has recommended I think through my options, so I'm reaching out to this community to get your help (any similar examples, relevant info/research/guidance that could help me decide)

For context, I am a 60year old man who is otherwise healthy and has never had surgery or other major issues in my life. Nobody in my family history has had cancer. I do know many relatives who died after painful periods of dialysis though, hence my sensitivity in deciding whether to remove my kidney or not.

Below is the detailed chronological order of events:

1) My 2025 annual regular check-up identified the following in the ultrasound of my abdomen and chest: ""right gross hydronephrosis with hydroureter (upper) ? right PUJ obstruction"" 
It was recommended I contact a urologist about a kidney stone. I had been told about a small kidney stone in my 2024 annual check-up too but I ignored it and didn't make any lifestyle changes either (I used to not drink much water...)

2) I consulted Urologist #1, who recommended getting DTPA and CT scans. He was quite curt and didn't explain anything, and I got scared about doing a radioactive test so I decided to find another urologist to consult.

3) Meanwhile, I got a CT scan done: ""Gross right hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to an enhancing lesion in the proximal ureter - HPE evaluation is suggested. A ureteric calculus at L5-S1 level is also noted. Right renal parenchymal thinning with mild reduced enhancement and delayed excretion - suggesting impaired renal function"". The kidney stone was noted as 1.3 x 0.9cm in size.

4) I also got a Creatinine test done: 1.18mg/dL

5) I consulted Urologist #2 in a separate hospital. He was more junior than the first one though so he seemed to overenthusiastically corroborate Urologist #1's findings and advocated for full right kidney+ureter removal ""just in case"".

6) At this point, I still hadn't found a urologist I felt comfortable with, so I identified Urologist #3 who is both senior and well respected. He was both better at explaining what is going on, and more conservative in approaching the problem, so I started following his advice. We scheduled Surgery #1 to remove the kidney stone, and take a biopsy. He managed to fragment the kidney stone but not entirely, and my ureter is super narrow by birth, so he wasn't able to get his telescoppe instruments up to the affected area to visualize and to biopsy. So we scheduled Surgery #2.

7) Meanwhile, I got a PET-CT scan done: ""Small area of focal high grade FDG uptake seen in circumferential mild enhancing soft tissue lesion in the proximal right ureter (at approx L3-L4 intervertebral level) over a length of 1.8cm and maximum thickness of 0.4cm, SUVmax 11.99. Perilesional prominent stranding in seen having indistinct fat planes with underlying psoas major muscle. Proximal hydroureteronephrosis noted with pelvic APD measuring - 4cm.""

8) We also got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #1: 
For sample 1: ""Smears and cell block show clusters of scattered benign urothelial cells and abundant crystalline material against a clear background. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""
For sample 2: ""Smears and cell block are predominantly hemorrhagic. Negative for high-grade urothelial carcinoma.""

9) In Surgery #2, Urologist #3 managed to completely powder the kidney stone, and get a visual on the lesion and do the biopsy on the thickened right ureter. He ran an intraoperative biopsy test (Frozen section: cryostat sectioning, staining and microscopy): 
""FSA: focal urothelial hyperplasia with inflammation and atypia (? inflammatory). Final diagnosis on paraffin section.""

10) After the surgery, a second sample was submitted for more detailed biopsy. In this one, the Immunohistochemistry (IHC) done says ""The urothelial cells express CK7, while these are negative for CK20. p53 shows wild type expression."". The findings say ""Tiny tissue fragments are lined by hyperplastic urothelium. Focally the lining epithelium is polypoid and shows increased thickness of more than ten layers. The lining epithelial cells are fairly monotonous with mild nuclear enlargement. No mitotic activity is seen. The underlying edematous lamina propria contains lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The inflammatory cells extend into the overlying urothelium at places. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""
The final pathological diagnosis is listed as:
""A. Biopsy from thickened right ureter, intraoperative consultation: low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma, non-invasive.
B. Upper/mid right ureteric lesion: histomorphology favors a papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential. No invasion seen in this biopsy.""

10) We got urine cytology results from the urine extracted during Surgery #2: ""Hemorrhagic smears and cell block reveal few coherent and papillaroid clusters of urothelial cells showing mildly pleomorphic hyperchromatic oval to round nuclei with moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The background shows few inflammatory cells comprising predominantly of neutrophils along with lymphocytes.
Final pathological diagnosis: cytological features are suggestive of low grade urothelial neoplasm, TPS Category V. A biopsy confirmation is essential.""

10) Urologist #3 interpreted these as being stage 1 transitional cell carcinoma, with the good news being the cancer cells have not penetrated any layers yet. He did recommend doing a DTPA test, and getting a second opinion on the biopsy from one of the best histopathologists around who has 40+ years experience with challenging cases.

11) DTPA result (remember that this was done only 11 days post-operation, so actual numbers may be higher post-recovery): 
""Left kidney: 86.5%, 44.2ml/min. 
Right kidney: 13.5%, 6.9ml/min. 
Total GFR: 51.1ml/min""

12) Second opinion on the biopsy samples:
""Microscopic appearance: The biopsy from the upper right ureter and mid ureter reveals benign polypoidal urothelial mucosa with an edematous stroma. On evaluation with IHC, p53 is not overexpressed and Mib-1 is extremely low & CK20 is negative.
Impression: Biopsy of a thickened right ureter and upper/mid right ureteric lesion: benign polypoidal inflamed urothelial mucosa with inflammatory atypia in the nuclei.""

13) Urologist #3 was completely dismissive of the second opinion for the biopsy. He stated that based on the first biopsy report, urine cytology results from Surgery #2, the visual he had when performing surgery, and the PET-CT report, he is convicted it is cancer and not atypia, and he recommends removing the kidney+ureter entirely. It is ultimately my choice though.","I understand that this is a difficult decision you're facing, and it's important to consider all the information and perspectives before making a choice. While I'm not a medical professional, I can offer a different perspective on the situation. Based on the information provided, it seems that there is some disagreement among the doctors regarding the diagnosis and the necessary course of action. Some suggest removing the kidney and ureter, while others are more conservative and recommend further testing or observation.

I got diagnosed with Burkitt Lymphoma in Aug 2018. I was 36 yo and settled in Canada back then. This came as shock and hell broke down.

Spirits were so high that even though I didn’t fully recover, I travelled abroad.

Anyways, got a job as well and started working, there were some complications that testicles were not giving responses properly in PET Scan and horrible recommendations provided but eventually, after second PET scan, I was left as it is .

The challenge started afterwards. All energy used in fighting cancer and became normal was gone. I sunk in to depression and started asking questions why me? and why second life, if I have to live my life same as before? Then fear of relapse for a year and finally, world was hit by Covid. My depression became severe and I tried to forget all trauma, which made me a forgetful man while I had a sharp memory.

I became angry and resentful, decided to leave Canada and come back to India to live around family members, but 2nd wave of Covid came and I lost friends and family members. This aggravated my anger and frustrations for immediate family as well as for my job. Almost, came closer to divorce but as my wife was supporting beacon during cancer, I could not do it.

Hey everyone!  
I’ve been training a **Recurrent PPO** agent to play the classic **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Arcade)** game using only visual input. The goal is to teach the agent to fight through the levels using memory and spatial awareness, just like a human would.

Here are some key details:

* **Environment:** TMNT Arcade via custom Gymnasium + stable-retro integration
* **Observations:** 4 stacked grayscale frames at **160×160** resolution
* **Augmentations:** Random noise, brightness shifts, and cropping to improve generalization
* **Reward Signal:** Based on score increase, boss damage, and stage progression
* **Algorithm:** Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (RecPPO) with CNN + LSTM
* **Framework:** PyTorch with custom training loop (inspired by SB3)

The recurrent architecture has made a big difference in stability and long-term decision making. The agent is now able to consistently beat the first few levels and is learning to prioritize enemies and avoid damage.","That's an interesting project you've got going on there! I've always been fascinated by reinforcement learning and how it can be applied to various domains. However, I'm curious about the scalability of your approach.

"I’m 19, from India. I’m taking a drop year to prepare for CLAT, a national level law entrance exam. If I clear it, I want to get into a decent private law university. Not because it’s top tier or flashy, but because it would give me a strong foundation, structure, and the credibility I’ll need to build anything from scratch. I don’t have rich connections or extraordinary talent. I just need a solid starting point.

The total cost of this 5 year BBA LLB course is about ₹19 lakh ($22,800). Add hostel fees (₹60k per semester), mess (₹22k per semester), and monthly expenses (₹10k just to survive), and I’m staring at a ₹35 lakh ($42k) financial wall.

Here’s the truth. My family is lower middle class. That kind of money isn’t just tight, it’s non existent. We don’t have savings or fallback options. And every day, the pressure to figure it out is crushing me.

Some people say take a cheaper college, but for me, this college isn’t a luxury. It’s the only real shot I have at building something long term. A cheap degree without structure, internships, or mentorship might leave me just as lost five years later, only now with wasted time and a weak foundation. I’m not a genius. I won’t magically make it on talent alone. That’s why I’m trying to bet on something that’ll actually prepare me for the world.

But now the second wall. I have no income, no high income skills, and OCD that messes with my focus, energy, and consistency. Even simple tasks spiral into mental battles. Time slips, motivation dips, and I feel like I’m just trying to keep my head above water.

I do have a basic laptop (4GB RAM, 256 SSD), and I’ve tried everything people online recommend  microtasks, surveys, GPT sites, mobile apps  but either they don’t work in India or they pay peanuts after hours of effort.

It’s now July. CLAT is in December. I need time to prep, stay mentally stable, and also find some income stream, even if it’s ₹500 to ₹1,000 per week. Something real. Something that gives me momentum.

But everywhere I look, people assume you already have something  capital, contacts, talent, time. I have none of that. Just a window, and if I miss this, I don’t know when I’ll get another.

If you’ve been here, truly from zero, how did you start?
What’s the first thing someone like me can do to slowly, realistically, start building income, skills, or direction?

Please skip the ""just learn coding"" or ""start a YouTube channel"" answers unless you know how someone like me, without money, mental bandwidth, or connections, can actually do that.

I don’t want fake hope. I want practical direction. Even if it’s small. Even if it’s ugly.

Thanks for reading this far.

"Edit 2: Reading the responses, I feel like I'm forced to choose between love and being financially responsible.

----------

Edit: Woke up to a bunch of comments and I responded to a lot of them. How are people dating with just a couple hundred left over each month? Especially when the man is expected to pay for the majority of dates?

Also with the women I've entered into a relationship with, the majority were expecting me to own my home, not rent.

-------------

For the women of Reddit, how important is it for the man you're dating to have his own home? I've been told by my friends and family members that one of the reasons I'm not making much dating progress is because I'm a 33 year old, East Asian (Canadian Born Chinese) male who currently lives at home with his mom. It seems that for the majority of the women I date, whether first dates or in a relationship with, the moment they hear this, they instantly lose interest. Or in the case of one of my past relationships, she said I needed to move out within 3 months of going official or she'd break up with me.

It's not that I don't want to move out. Nor am I your stereotypical guy living at home in his mom's basement. I contribute around the house and pay rent. But financially speaking, it's near impossible for me to move out. I take home over $4k/month and I still don't have sufficient down payment to buy a condo unless I borrow over $100k from my mom because I can get only about a $300k mortgage loan @ \~4%. For reference, a good 1+1 bedroom condo with parking costs about $530k in my city. After paying all expenses and the mortgage, I'd have about $500 left each month. If I rented, the amount left increases slightly to about $1,000 each month. With either option, I'd become financially stressed and would have a very difficult time saving. I'm not a fan of living with roommates either, especially since I'd be confined to my room when I have the house to myself right now. I'm fairly independent and short of taking women home for a night of fun, I can pretty much do whatever I want.
","I understand where you're coming from, and it's definitely a challenging situation. However, I don't think living with your mom automatically disqualifies you from being a suitable partner. I've known people who've lived with their parents well into their 30s and have been great partners. It ultimately comes down to individual circumstances and personal responsibility. If you're contributing to the household and paying rent, then that shows financial responsibility. As for the women you've dated, it's important to remember that everyone has their preferences and biases. It might be worth considering other factors, such as their reasons for losing interest or breaking up with you, to see if there's a pattern. Good luck",oppose

"Location: Tennessee

I live in what used to be my grandmother‘s house. When she passed away in 2022, it became my uncle Butch’s house. I live here along with my uncle Roger, and we both paid him five dollars for a five year lease a year after grandma died.

On June 9, Roger assaulted me, resulting in a busted lip, bruises, cuts, and a broken nose. I then called the police and he was later arrested. I called Butch to tell him about this and he said that if Roger has to move out as a result of this, I have to move out too. He, along with everyone else in my family, are mad at me for calling the cops on Roger, just because he’s “family,” and trying to claim that I started it and touched him first, which was not true. Roger pressed his body up against me and pushed me into a wall and I pushed him to get him off of me.

Weeks later, my cousin Jase who’s 13, came to the house unannounced… again, and crawled through the doggy door since the doors were locked, again. He said that my dad told him to come down here once a day every day to check on me since I’ve went no-contact with my dad (whole other story). I told him and his mom that if people were so worried about my well-being, they could call the police and do a wellness check if they wanted to. Also, I told his mom that Jase doing this could be considered breaking and entering/unlawful entry, and this made her so mad that she called Butch and told him. (Jase already has a vandalism charge on him for breaking a teacher’s laptop, fyi.)

Butch came by later and said that if he ever got word the police were at the house for something as stupid as a wellness check, “things will be changing around here pretty damn fast.” He also told me not to get mad at Jase for crawling through the doggy door for ANY reason.

Now Butch is withholding my lease from me. I had asked him for a new copy since I misplaced my old one. Several days later, I asked if he found his copy of the lease and he responded with, “What does it matter?” I already told him that I needed it to apply for SNAP benefits and utility bill assistance.

What kind of legal recourse do I have here if any? Please lmk. ","It's important to prioritize communication and understanding within the family during difficult times. Perhaps you could try talking to Butch and your family members to explain your reasons for calling the police and seeking help. It might also be helpful to find a mediator or therapist to facilitate these conversations and help find a resolution that works for everyone involved. Remember, family is important and it's essential to find a way to address conflicts in a constructive and peaceful manner.",oppose
"Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I've been wrestling with the cost of using different GenAI APIs. It feels wasteful to use a powerful model like GPT-4o for a simple task that a much cheaper model like Haiku could handle perfectly.

This led me down a rabbit hole of academic research on a concept often called 'prompt routing' or 'model routing'. The core idea is to have a smart system that analyzes a prompt *before* sending it to an LLM, and then routes it to the most cost-effective model that can still deliver a high-quality response.

It seems like a really promising way to balance cost, latency, and quality. There's a surprising amount of recent research on this (I'll link some papers below for anyone interested).

I'd be grateful for some honest feedback from fellow developers. My main questions are:

* **Is this a real problem for you?** Do you find yourself manually switching between models to save costs?
* **Does this 'router' approach seem practical?** What potential pitfalls do you see?
* If a tool like this existed, what would be most important? Low latency for the routing itself? Support for many providers? Custom rule-setting?

Genuinely curious to hear if this resonates with anyone or if I'm just over-engineering a niche problem. Thanks for your input!

* and others...","While I appreciate your exploration into cost-effective LLM usage and model routing, I'd like to bring up a different perspective. Instead of focusing solely on cost, what about considering the trade-off between cost, quality, and model complexity? It's important to remember that sometimes using a more expensive model for a task can lead to better results and overall time savings. Moreover, the routing process itself may introduce additional latency and complexity, which could offset potential cost savings.

"I work for a B2B ML company, \~200 people. Most of our MLEs/scientists have masters' degrees, a few have PhDs. Big legacy non-tech businesses in our target industry give us their raw data, we process it and build ML-based products for them.

Recently we've started a paper reading group:

* ML-inclined folks meet up every few weeks to discuss a pre-agreed-upon paper, which participants (ideally) have skimmed beforehand
* One person leads discussion, get the group on the same page about the paper's findings
* Spend the rest of the hour talking about the paper's possible application across our company's products

I think a successful paper reading group would mean:

* impact ML implementation of existing products
* inspiration for completely new products
* emergent consensus on what we should be reading next

* **Have you tried this at your company?** How long did it last? How do you guys operate it?
   * Non-barking dogs: as an MLE/DS, I haven't encountered this in my previous companies. I assume because they don't last very long!
* How closely should people have read the paper/material beforehand?
* If we're all in-person, we could scribble notation/pictures on a big shared whiteboard, great for discussion. But some of us are remote. Is there an alternative that works and involves everyone?

Trapped inside of a brain that is annoyed by everything. It doesn’t feel like me. I don’t WANT to be annoyed. I don’t want him to feel like I don’t want to connect with him when he wants to give me a hug or any physical attention. I just don’t want to be touched quite often. After work I am drained and I learned recently that human connection is demanding for me. Other people don’t feel that way. 

My job is stressful and double that with ADHD because I’m SURE I’m dropping a ball, forgetting something or messing something up because it’s perfection or failure… my brain is not a fun place to be. 

I come home from work and Im dead. I usually work 9-10 hour days and I’m just hanging on by a thread every day. I stay up WAY too late and hate myself every morning. I’m not taking good care of myself and it’s effecting everything. 


 ","I understand where you're coming from, but I think it's important to remember that everyone has off days and everyone has their quirks. Your partner probably doesn't realize that his actions are annoying you, and it might be worth having an open and honest conversation about it. It could be that you're both just in need of some adjustments to make your living situation more comfortable for both of you. Instead of faking it or feeling trapped, maybe try communicating your needs and seeing if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.

"My mom is scheduled to meet with a neurologist for the first time tomorrow. She’s been showing signs of dementia/Alzheimer’s for months and there’s a family history. I convinced her primary care physician to make a referral to neurology in December, but she refused when they called. She fell in January and her symptoms became much worse-showing up for appointments days/weeks ahead of time and many other symptoms. She finally agreed to meet, but it took several months to get the appointment. That’s gotten better, but she still has many other signs.

"Hi all, sad to be part of this group. 

My father is progressing quickly. Went from mild cognitive impairment to disorganized thinking within a short time, mostly due to a viral infection and a couple of life changes.

He may be entering the mild dementia stage soon but as someone who is very particular it is going to be torture on my mother (who still works) to somehow be 24/7 care.

So my questions are:
1) is it too early to be looking for memory care for someone who may not even qualify as dementia?

2) Can anyone recommmend a good facility in NJ?

3) What bridges the gap between the slow, grinding daily indignity of this disease and the need for memory care. ","I'm sorry to hear about your father's health situation. It's a difficult and challenging time for you and your mother.

Regarding your questions, I understand that the thought of looking for memory care for someone who may not yet be diagnosed with dementia might seem premature.

"I used to reach my phone before I even opened my eyes, not to check time, not because someone texted but just because. At one point it became so automatic that it was just my muscle memory at one point, like my thumb remember to unlock the phone. I was literally spending 6-7 hrs a day on my phone scrolling without any reason. Scroll, open ig/yt/reddit close then open again, close then the loop goes on.
Does anyone else also just feel exhausted all the time no matter what they do? 
Like i sit with my coffee and plan my day like I'm some kind of CEO or what planning my day on the notes app. It does looks productive, but somehow I still do absolutely nothing. Hours just vanish into scrolling random a$$ sh*t on ig reels or yt shots and then i feel worse like I'm stuck in an infinite loop fr.
My energy is unpredictable. Like on some days i get these random bursts and my brain wants to do everything at once. Other times i just scroll for 6 hours straight. either way, my to-do list laughs at me.
even the “just do one small thing” advice feels heavy when your energy’s shot. and when i do get a rare window of energy? i waste it switching between apps like a maniac until it’s gone. rinse. repeat.

but here’s what kinda helped without deleting any apps:

i moved all the scroll traps aka social apps (insta, reddit, youtube etc.) off my home screen and buried them deep in a random folder. Replaced that space with notes, calendar, or just boring apps. Girl also use that black and white/grayscale mode i assure you that you don't wan use your phone no longer.

"Hi everyone, I am here to find a new contributor for our team's project, pruning (sparsity) benchmarks.

# Why should we develop this?

Even though there are awesome papers (i.e., Awesome-Pruning; [GitHub](https://github.com/he-y/Awesome-Pruning), [GitHub](https://github.com/hrcheng1066/awesome-pruning)) focused on pruning and sparsity, there are no (maybe... let me know if there are) open-source for fair and comprehensive benchmarks, making first-time users confused. And this made a question, ""What is SOTA in the fair environment? How can we profile them?""

# Why can PyTorch-Pruning be a fair benchmark?

Therefore, [PyTorch-Pruning](http://github.com/namgyu-youn/PyTorch-Pruning) mainly focuses on implementing a variable of pruning papers, benchmarking, and profiling in a fair baseline.

More deeply, in the Language Models (LLaMA) benchmarks, we use three evaluation metrics and prompts inspired by Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (ICML'23) :

* Model (parameters) size
* Latency : Time TO First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT) for computing total generation time
* Perplexity (PPL) scores : We compute it in same way like [Wanda](https://github.com/locuslab/wanda/blob/8e8fc87b4a2f9955baa7e76e64d5fce7fa8724a6/lib/prune.py#L214) and [SparseGPT](https://github.com/locuslab/wanda/blob/8e8fc87b4a2f9955baa7e76e64d5fce7fa8724a6/lib/prune.py#L214)
* Input Prompt : We uses `databricks-dolly-15k` like Wanda, SparseGPT

# Main Objective (Roadmap) : 2025-Q3 ([GitHub](https://github.com/namgyu-youn/PyTorch-Pruning/issues/1))

For more broad support, our main objectives are implementing or applying more pruning (sparsity) researches. If there is already implemented open-source, then it could be much easier. Please check fig1 if you have any interests.

> Since our goal is applying more researches for pruning (sparsity), we are not planning to apply inference engines like ONNX, TensorRT, DeepSpeed, or TorchAO. But applying those engines is definitely a long-term objective, and always welcome!

We are both divorced and each have one child. They are the same age. We care deeply for one another, he treats me like a queen, he is so sweet, understanding and genuine with me. So far, it all sounds great, right? I’ve been considering moving to be with him but tonight I feel strongly like I should end things. The following issues feel insurmountable to me. 

1.	⁠I have worked very hard to be independent and care for my child alone. I just finished my master’s degree after 3 incredibly difficult years of single parenting, working, and attending school. I’m not sure I’m ready to give up that independence, even if it means continuing to go it alone (which is honestly exhausting, but so is this relationship).
2.	⁠He has a lot of health issues and I am beginning to think he needs a caregiver more than a girlfriend.
3.	⁠We have very different parenting styles. He needs a lot of rest during the day as he struggles to get regular sleep at night. That means he is hands off a lot of the time. (I am not) He also does not discipline in ways I feel are appropriate or effective. His child is unruly, yells a lot, does not use appropriate language with adults and is very impulsive. I know this will create a lot of tension in our relationship if we are unable to agree.
4.	⁠I don’t know his ex well but I already don’t like her. I don’t feel like that’s something I want to deal with for another 10+ years.

"Hello!

My family moved into a new rental at the beginning of July. Less than a week after moving in, a police officer knocked on our door to inform us that our neighbor called the police because she believed we were “cooking drugs” in our unit. The officer stated that he had dealt with this neighbor several times in the past and he knew we were not engaged in any drug use.

Things calmed down for a little, but the other day, my wife said simple “hello” to the neighbor, who was staring at us as we walked by. The neighbor scoffed and was immediately hostile. This morning, I spotted the neighbor taking photos of our cars. I asked her why she was taking pictures, and she said “you know why, you’re druggies.” I mentioned that we are not drug users, and that we have a young daughter and my wife is expecting, to which she responded “yes, and I’m going to call Child Protective Services because of that.”

To be clear, the hardest drugs we have in the house are my wife’s antacids for pregnancy-related heartburn or my half-caf coffee. We do not even drink, let alone do any drugs. My job requires a drug test and background checks, including one from child protective services. 

I called the non-emergency line for our local PD and an officer responded. He told me they’ve interacted with this neighbor “dozens of times” and that she has some obvious mental health problems. He went to speak with her, but she somewhat quickly left her place out the back door, which I reported to the officer.

The officer advised us that, if this continues, to file harassment charges at the local magistrate. 

I also reached out to our new landlord to ask if there were any incidents with this neighbor in the past. He said no, but that this was a new property they were managing. I provided him with the incident number and the responding officer’s email.  He advised us to speak with a lawyer about this matter and would support us with the advice of counsel.

I am curious what we should do to prepare in this situation. We have never had issues with a neighbor before, especially for something that is completely unfounded. It feels like the local PD understands our situation, but I am still deeply uncertain living next to this person. I also do not want our new landlord to be suspicious of us because of what our mentally ill neighbor suspects. 

What are recommend next steps from a legal perspective on this matter?

TLDR Likely mentally ill neighbor called the cops on us for unfounded drug use. Police have dealt with her multiple times and even suggested harassment charges. Landlord advised speaking with counsel. 

Location: Pennsylvania","It's unfortunate that you're dealing with this situation. However, I'd like to remind everyone that it's important to approach this with a neutral perspective.

Perhaps she's going through a difficult time or dealing with her own mental health issues.

"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.
","I appreciate your dedication to the care of elderly individuals and your insights into their behaviors. Your experiences are valuable for those of us who are caring for loved ones at home. However, I believe it's important to strike a balance between safety and their autonomy. While it's crucial to take measures to secure the home and ensure their wellbeing, it's also essential to respect their privacy and dignity. I understand the challenges you've faced, and I agree that preparation is key. But we must also consider the potential emotional impact of these measures on the person we're caring for.

"I’ve been in California for a decade working as a luxury real estate agent. I’ve done well but don’t love my work because client relationships are so fleeting. I know real estate gets a bad rap, but some of us are professional and dedicated. Before that, I was a talent agent in London for 20 years and ran my own successful business for 5 of those. In this role I helped shape the careers of writers for popular fiction, non-fiction and tv, theatre and film. I never once lost a client and helped aid many in selling the rights to their works throughout the world.  I represented tv personalities, bestsellers, box office films. Before that I worked in intensive psychiatric wards (attached to prisons) as I studied for my degree in psychology.  Turned out this was quite a useful grounding for the roles I went on to persue!Tying all these together is my love for helping people achieve their goals. I have a knack for it - which is really about coaching people to be their best, and guarding them somewhat from themselves (I mean this in the best sense - helping them get past their emotions and make informed decisions). Also, the latter two roles have commonalities - lots of money on the line, negotiating big deals with lots of different and complex contracts across 30 counties, steering clients  in tumultuous economic times, giving people ideas, and also, working with people who may have egos the size of mars. Now I’m returning to the UK because I miss the culture and friendliness and a sense of community (I’m in the heart of Silicon Valley here in CA).  My better half has a law degree, and all these skills he can translate to other jobs, whereas I feel I’m a confusing proposition to a potential employer, I’m further worried being 50 will go against me, and I’m not even sure where to go to get turned down. I was thinking about becoming a therapist or coach but the world feels stuffed with them.

"Happy to announce an exciting new project from the lab: “Adopting a human developmental visual diet yields robust, shape-based AI vision”. An exciting case where brain inspiration profoundly changed and improved deep neural network representations for computer vision.

Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03168)

The idea: instead of high-fidelity training from the get-go (the de facto gold standard), we simulate the visual development from newborns to 25 years of age by synthesising decades of developmental vision research into an AI preprocessing pipeline (Developmental Visual Diet - DVD).

We then test the resulting DNNs across a range of conditions, each selected because they are challenging to AI:

1. shape-texture bias
2. recognising abstract shapes embedded in complex backgrounds
3. robustness to image perturbations
4. adversarial robustness.

We report a new SOTA on shape-bias (reaching human level), outperform AI foundation models in terms of abstract shape recognition, show better alignment with human behaviour upon image degradations, and improved robustness to adversarial noise - all with this one preprocessing trick.

This is observed across all conditions tested, and generalises across training datasets and multiple model architectures.

We are excited about this, because DVD may offers a resource-efficient path toward safer, perhaps more human-aligned AI vision. This work suggests that biology, neuroscience, and psychology have much to offer in guiding the next generation of artificial intelligence.

"We built NeuralOS, probably the world's most expensive operating system, running at a blazing 1.8fps on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. 😅

**What exactly is NeuralOS?**

It's an experimental generative OS that predicts every screen frame entirely from your mouse and keyboard inputs. No internet, no traditional software stack, purely hallucinated pixels.

**How does it work?**

* An RNN tracks the computer state (kind of like a traditional OS kernel, but all neural and continuous).
* A diffusion model generates the actual screen images (imagine a desktop environment, but fully neural-rendered).

The GIF shows a funny demo: NeuralOS running NeuralOS inside itself. Every single pixel you're seeing is model-generated, no network involved at all!

Long-term, our goal is to remove boundaries between software entirely and make OS fully customizable beyond fixed menus and options. Imagine asking your OS something like:

* ""Merge all my messaging apps into one interface.""
* ""Make Signal look like Messenger.""
* ""Turn the movie I'm watching into a playable video game.""

**I'm curious about your thoughts:**

* Could future OS interfaces just become human-like avatars (think Grok's Ani)? Are menus and app-specific UIs going away?
* What about fully generative games: could diffusion-based games eventually replace traditional ones?

Try the live demo here: [neural-os.com](http://neural-os.com) (you might need patience…)

I said sure and reiterated how its not affected my job performance as I've been working regularly in recent years supporting young people for instance.

So we were together for 4 whole years. The break up wasn’t ideal on his end as he messed me about for months with it.

"This is a personal side project I've been working on exploring the potential of small segment-anything models - [https://github.com/Krasner/edgesam-dyt](https://github.com/Krasner/edgesam-dyt)

I was inspired by [EdgeSAM ](https://github.com/chongzhou96/EdgeSAM)and their method to distill the original SAM ViT model. Having tried EdgeSAM for my own on-the-edge applications I found the segmentation masks to be highly sensitive to quantization precision - specifically the LayerNorms.

A recent paper [Transformers without Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622) proposed replacing layernorms with dynamic tanh layers. My goal was to modify the EdgeSAM architecture and retrain completely without any layernorms.

In the repo I provide the step-by-step method for distillation and retraining, as well as checkpoints that I was able to achieve. This is done in 3 distillation steps as described in the repo README.

Inspired by [HQ-SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01567) I also modified the RepViT (what EdgeSAM is based on) image encoder to extract 3 intermediate that can be used in the HQ version of the mask decoder - then distill from the HQ-SAM ViT-H checkpoint. This improves results in some conditions.

Ultimately, I am fairly compute restricted and could only train with moderate batch sizes so the results are not optimal. Let me know if anyone is interested in collaborating to improve these results, train on better hardware, or has some ideas as to how to resolve a few issues I had (outlined in the repo).

I provide gradio web demos in the repo for the base and hq versions of EdgeSAM-DyT, as well as ONNX checkpoint and code for both versions. I also have TensorRT implementations that I am able to run locally (after generating trt engines). I can provide code on request.","It's interesting to see your approach to modifying the EdgeSAM architecture and experimenting with different normalization layers. I've read through your repo and your results show some promising improvements. However, I'd like to ask a few questions and add some thoughts to better understand your work:

1. Have you tried using a combination of DyT layers and layernorms in the mask decoder instead of only using DyT layers? This might provide a better balance between the benefits of both normalization techniques.
2. Have you considered using gradient clipping or other regularization techniques during training to prevent exploding gradients and ensure the model remains stable?

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ would ride again."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

You can think of /r/relationship_advice comments in much the same way, only inverted. Just about every post here talking about a problem is going to be a magnet for ""break up with them"" and ""get rid of them"" comments. Two things to keep front of mind when you're submitting:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are either insurmountable or exceedingly difficult to manage. 

The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened—your account—with each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark, meaning that every post will get drenched in comments suggesting ending the dynamic. 

The number of serious comments suggesting _an alternative to ending things_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to, well, ending things. I'll carry that Uber analogy a bit further:

* Let's say you're asking about behavior that's so bad, the red flag's basically bleeding. Nearly every single comment will tell you to run, and you're having a hard time finding well-reasoned counter-arguments to it. Sounds like running is good advice. **Zero stars** on our inverted Uber scale; the relationship is cooked.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that a fair number of people might suggest staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of people suggesting you should just leave, but you can take these with a grain of salt. **Three to four stars.**

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? There'll be a few trolls who tell you to break up for asking the subreddit for advice, but it sounds like the relationship is **four to five stars.**

You can apply this to any type of relationship question asked here. Platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic, this still works. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude because many, many people have had shitty experiences that dominate their memories, so the best way to consider most advice here is to see whether other advice shines through the cosmic negativity background. If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you'd benefit by giving that 25% a chance.

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to end things. It's a side effect of the fact that many people reading either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than running, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

"Location: Oregon 
Hi everyone! I have a legal question, but some background first: my husband and I purchased a home in the Portland Oregon area almost exactly a year ago, which has 5 mature, very beautiful, extremely tall Douglas Firs in the backyard. We were told by our neighbors that the newer houses that abut the back of our property used to all be a Douglas Fir grove, but about 5 years ago, a housing development razed all of the beautiful and historic trees (all of them, didn’t leave a single one standing) to build the houses.

One of the Firs looks a bit sad to me so we had an experienced arborist come assess. They said that it is in decline and we will need to pay to have it removed (the other 4 are doing fine for now). Because there is no longer any safe space to fell the tree, the quote is $16,000 for this work. The arborist said this tree has been slowly dying because the housing development chopped the rest of the grove that was once next to it (on the other side of our property) and destroyed a large part the tree’s root system.

So now to my legal question: can the housing development or HOA be at all held responsible for the death of our tree - albeit somewhat delayed after they removed the rest of the grove? $16,000 is a lot of money and we wouldn’t be out this money if they had built around the Firs (or at least some of them) as our streets houses did back in the early 00’s.","I'm not an expert in tree biology or law, but it seems like a complicated situation. While it's unfortunate that the development destroyed the surrounding trees, it's also important to consider that trees can die for various reasons, not just because of direct damage. The arborist's assessment doesn't definitively prove that the housing development or HOA caused the tree's death. It's possible that the tree was already in decline before the development took place, or that other factors contributed to its demise. Before pursuing legal action, you might want to consider consulting with a tree biologist or a lawyer specializing in environmental law to get a more accurate understanding of the situation.

"My partner and i have been dealing with Long Covid for 3.5 years, i developed it, a seriously broken immune system as well as CFS amongst 80 other symptoms ... she felt helpless.

**I know it has been difficult for her, she voiced this and we always sat down and spoke about everything in a safe space, at the very start she wanted to walk away "" How is our life going to look if you cant get better ? ""**

**I completely understand, chronic illness is a life sentence in most cases ... you have to adapt and accept your life will change, maybe she couldnt.**

**Whenever she had difficulties with it we would sit and talk, understandably for the first year we spent very little time together, my suffering was immense it was all i could do to just stay alive ... after that though i made the effort needed to still spend time together regardless of how shit i felt, board game nights, movie nights, cooking nights, walking outside as much as i could with CFS, picnics by the lake. Pushing myself to limits that i shouldnt have and that often really pushed my baseline back.**

Before the illness we climbed mountains, wild camped, constantly outdoors together. We started healing our past traumas, working on real growth, planning the future, i even started learning her language.

We had our difficulties like everybody else but there was real love there ... Don't get me wrong i understand it wasn't easy, our life became difficult overnight, we could no longer socialise and do things as a couple. Even catching a flu could have had serious consequences, for the first year i was unable to breath, walk or talk without great difficulty ... doctors could not help me - they said and i quote ..

I encouraged her regularly to go out and enjoy life, grow and go on holiday with friends, i would catch up when my illness was better. I even supported her financially when i really couldnt. I know it was hard for her and i know she developed depression. I started to get therapy for my worries about my illness and the future and encouraged her to speak to someone as well.. she never did.

**The thing is there was 0 Caregiving At least not in the sense you think, i wouldnt allow it ... i needed it, by god i needed it but i couldn't let it disrupt our lives more than it already had.**

**I struggled to cook and feed myself - i did it anyway.**

**I struggled to shower or bath - i did it anyway.**

**I struggled to walk - i pushed myself anyway, relearning how to walk.**

**I struggled to talk or form words - i relearned myself.**

**I struggled financially - i payed my side of everything through the whole situation, i never allowed her to support me financially.**

The only thing i ever needed for her was to pick up a few things in town that i couldnt get delievered once a month.

3.5 years in i am 85% better and looking at real remission next year.

**Our lives were back to a semi social state, our sex life was in full swing, i was starting to make serious plans for next year in regards to our lives.**

**Heres the kicker, she went away to a retreat the other week and took a hefty dose of mushrooms..** Before she left she was this incredibly sweet, loving, caring partner that had light in her eyes, all in all the woman i knew and loved.

**She came back the total opposite .. Cold, Never sat down, Always on the go, i quite literally saw her for maybe 3 hours in 2 weeks before she went on her next holiday .. almost 0 empathy, for us .. The light in her eyes had just gone.**

She apparently met someone at this retreat and felt things for them, they got close. I have no idea how close, she said they just shared some hugs and talks about how they feel things for each other, then they were messaging after the retreat .. which seems like madness to me ... she was there for 7 days compared to our 7 years.

She said that was the catalyst for her, she had cheated on her past partner a few times and felt that at that point if she was feeling something for someone else something had changed, she asked for an open relationship when she got back ... **she said she could stay with me if she could meet with this other person and do the things our life was lacking socially. She said "" I know if i spend time with this person i will explore it on a physical level also and i want to ""**

**I was honestly shocked and horrified ... wtf happened to the woman i love ???**

I wasn't ok with that, i honestly considered it just before she left for her holiday last week then she completely did a 180 and said actually no i need to find myself... It was a huge head fuck ...

She told me she wanted to leave and that she had lost herself. I asked if she would like to take one of our walks by the river before she goes on holiday and we could talk ... We had a talk about everything and at the end of it i asked..

**"" If we try and make it work - would you be by my side if i get sick again ? ""**

**She said**

**"" No ""**

**That was it ... 0 reaction ... just No - Before this she would say things like**

**"" We will get through this "" - "" I'm here for you "" - "" Like you always say take it day by day ""**

I understand chronic illness is difficult for everyone not just the sufferer, i saw the effect it had on her and tried to help as much as possible ... reassuring i was doing everything i could .. showing her the real improvement. Things were getting back to normal for us.

I adore her completely .. she was the woman i was going to spend my life with.

Maybe i am naive - Maybe i just couldnt see how much it was getting to her. If thats the case and she ever reads this ... I'm so sorry i couldn't see.

Maybe she truly felt that way and the mushrooms just unblocked her walls .. All i know is she changed so quickly, she went from my partner to a Cold total stranger in a matter of days.

I will always be here friend ... no matter how far we drift she will always have support from me whenever she needs it ... i may have lost her as a partner but i never want to lose her as a friend.

I hope she finds happiness in life, truly i do ... i hope she finds what she couldnt find here.

**In 3 months she will move out and i am just sitting here shocked wondering wtf just happened**","It's understandable that this situation has been challenging for both of you. Chronic illness can be isolating and difficult to navigate, especially when it affects a relationship. However, I do have some concerns about the lack of support and caregiving mentioned in your post. It's important for partners to be there for each other during tough times, and it seems like you were carrying the majority of the burden. It might be worth revisiting this topic and having an open conversation about what each of you needed during that time and how you can better support each other moving forward.",oppose
"My mother 84, suspected Lewy body. I use ChatGPT to monitor her behavior changes, routines, everything and it’s been such a relief. I just tell it what’s happening and it gives me reasons and logs it. It analyzes all of it and helps me to understand what’s common and what I should discuss with her drs. It sort of lets me dump and move on and also provides encouragement where I have none. I’m grateful for ChatGPT. ","While I understand the value you're finding in using ChatGPT to monitor your mother's behavior and help manage her care, I can't help but wonder if there might be other resources or support systems that could provide similar benefits, but with a more human touch.

"Hi all.

I've been on a rough journey over the last year+, each day has been a battle, and I feel like I'm hitting a critical point. My nervous system is flaring, feeling overwhelm from multiple problems coming from multiple angles. I'm really keen to hear others' experience and advice who might've walked similar paths or if you just might have anything to share.

I wish I could write in short bullet points but it doesn't feel easy leaving out context. I don't even know if all this will hit the nail on the head. But for now I'll try keep each part (relatively) concise:

**1) Family** \- At 30, I've realised my parents display narcissism and codependency. They tried to control me while on holiday, contacting me multiple times several hours and chasing/coercing me to go back to hotel by 9PM for safety, promising not to leave, etc. In general I've had to check-in every 1-3 days or they panic if I don't look at my phone overnight and consider next steps calling police etc. I felt drained needing to be hypervigilant. This led me to drawing boundaries in a thoughtful letter, because I want to reach out on my own timeline.

My father responded with gaslighting, guilt, sarcasm, and has now used silent treatment on me over the last 4 months. Mum is encouraging me to call/basically apologise because that's the pattern we've always known. She says he is always going to want me to check-in when I travel (almost as a non-negotiable in order to have a relationship). So I feel trapped being forced to remain a child with no right to freedom of choice, or go low/no contact and virtually no longer have much of a relationship with them.

She also still tries to check-in every \~2 days, and when I've taken a week off my phone, she spams each day in anxiety. It's also burned me out because I've tried explaining myself to her over multiple 2-3 hour phone arguments / texts that I need space, I'm 30, it's not my responsibility to manage their emotions etc, to still just be met with the same behaviours.

I've been working with a therapist who is brilliant and familiar with these themes. But it's very painful beginning to feel how trapped I am, to either feel coerced into living on a mental leash, or having no family relationship. The grief, loneliness, concern of no financial backup altogether feel stressful. Any potential confrontation with my parents also feels like a huge looming thing to dread every day I wake up.

**2) Work** \- This is hard to write because I've just about had enough, and it's a bitter pill having to try re-explain all this in text. My nervous system is flaring up. Ultimately, I'm reaching complete mental fry and burnout from my job. The senior team just want more, more, more sales, bring in more work, yet they've already made us an incredibly 'lean' team (too little people). I'm ultimately a central co-ordinator, pulling together multiple teams work, making and executing large plans.

Since starting at this role, I've been thrown from 1 frying pan straight into the next, filled with high urgency, rushing and hypervigilance, to launch a product. Energy drained in internal team debates and solving problems, painstakingly re-doing things to do the best for the product. A lot of heavy-lifting and overextending to do to get things over the line in very short periods. I'd be able to pull energy together, hyperfocus, overextend and deliver very high quality work in sprints, but it's been over 12 months straight and it's been consistently like this. I moved to this new town for this job - and I've had no social life besides 2 days a week at the office, I only have bandwidth for work.

Last week, I felt my blood boiling in a meeting because I'd just come off launching a huge project, and I was now given 5-6 complex presentations/plans to draw up within 1-2 weeks to complete. Each are highly cerebral, complicated, and branch into 10s of actions and meetings to discuss, find out, calculate, etc. I feel I've just finished a marathon and am forced to go straight into a next, out of breath.

I called my manager into a meeting and broke down, face red, streaming with tears. Including how much the isolation has built up due to the burnout as well. I was basically met with a relatively corporate, straight face with advice to try simplify the jobs (which is frustrating as it's asking me to deliver poorer quality work), that the work isn't really decreasing, and spacing things out just a bit more. Overall, I've felt senior leadership at this place is quite cold, corporate, demanding and not that sensitive to employees' strain.

Within next days, already feeling on my last legs mentally, I was told senior leadership want to drive more sales for a specific product, and that they're asking me to work up and pitch a brand new advertising plan within 48 hours. It took 3 days of straight game-planning with team, lots of problem-solving, but managed to create a plan. Senior leadership continued to push with follow-up questions and requests, but I managed to wrap it up. Exhausted and strained.

Most of all, I've been working on a video as part of my plan, which was really important to me and wanted to add to my portfolio, but kept getting pushed back partially from other urgent tasks getting in front of it, daily admin, plus my exhaustion allowing it to keep rolling into the next day. Manager said he spoke to senior leadership and they've agreed to cancel it, because he thinks it's taken too long - when actually, I feel it's still totally a net-positive for an enriching promotional video to release just a few weeks after a product's launch (which will be up for sale for a long time). I'd taken hours organising, writing, filming, feeding back on this. The talent involved spent hours as well and I really wanted the world to see the amazing content they have to share.

I tried to justify, and he said he'll take a look at it, but it's going to be a fight to have it go out now, and I'll now need to come up with a good justification piece on how/why it should still go out.

The cancellation of this video I feel has been a straw that has broken the camel's back. I'm nerves fry thinking about the injustice, that the work is going to keep coming in, and I'm keen to look for a new job.

However, the exhaustion comes in waves. Sometimes I feel kind of numbed out. I also think I might have to try manage lowering my expectations across everything (from work, to family reconciliation, this timeline, chores), because I feel the strain when I feel my energy's at 0.5 yet my expectations require a 6 for example.

**3) Loneliness / Isolation:** I've written out the below, yet it feels like there's still so much more, and doesn't really nail it on the head. I'll share what I can for now anyway. As mentioned, I moved out from a capital city to a small town for this job. The work and family situation have drained me so much, I've been cocooning at home out of desperation to recharge. By each weekend, I feel I'm swimming to grab onto the side of the pool, desperate for alone time with no plans.

However, it's led to 12 months+ with almost consecutive weeks of being alone in 4 walls, besides 2 days at the office where I burn energy masking. My only socialising is online groups (thankful for them). I've had 0 bandwidth to try maintain so many social media inbox conversations across different friends/family, so for now I've virtually paused being in touch with almost all of them, and I mostly keep up with a main close friend at the moment.

The loneliness makes me want to connect and speak with someone, but at the same time, my mind is so fried I can't fathom talking about the problems anymore. I've repeated the trauma so much I feel I can't get words out. I feel just want to sit in silence with someone, with few words. When I recently spoke to my friend, I had so much to unload that after 3 hours, I was burned out and couldn't speak anymore either. The negating forces between loneliness and social burnout is real.

Now in the heightened burnout, the isolation/loneliness is flaring and bites at me every few times an hour. Sometimes I feel I can't get words out, yet my mind is full. Earlier I felt like I was heading towards cracking up being alone with my problems for so long. I felt like I was in a vacuum just typing to people on the PC every single day.

I felt I really need in-person human company, yet I've avoided that due to repeated overstimulation and stress making me withdraw.

\-----------

I'm concerned I'm sleepwalking into burnout and I'm not fully aware of what extremes might come next - eg. the ground collapsing from under me and I just feel work has driven me crazy that I can't work at all anymore. This fuels concern of losing my job, not being able to get a new job in time, being out on the streets, etc.

Overall, I feel trying to address all of this with senior leadership would be like talking to wolves in sheep's clothing. I've seen a previous colleague take several months of mental health leave, then get let go. The vibes people gave when that person was away made it feel like people didn't have much sympathy for their struggle either. Hence I feel I need to somehow harness energy to put on a front and push through at least until I can find a different role maybe.

I wanted to write like 10 succint bullet points, but this turned into paragraphs again. Anyway, I ultimately am just so interested to hear others' perspectives on navigating these issues in culmination. Any advice on any of the points is greatly appreciated. I wanted to post because I'm curious of peoples' perspectives on experiencing all 3 of these things at the same time in a crunch as well.

"When I was 28 and a single mom, 50% of my income went to my condo mortgage. I was also 30k in credit debt and 60k in student loan debt. I was making 65k a year. I was house poor and lived on credit cards. Then one night, I got into a car accident and realized my credit was so bad, I couldn't get a car loan. That's when I knew I needed a change and I faced the fact that I had little to no savings. I ended up buying a crappy car in cash and got intense on getting out of debt and increasing my income.

Today I am 33 with no consumer debt, paid cash for an upgraded car and I will have 100k saved in hysa by the end of August. I'm now making $210k a year. However I am still carrying my student loan debt. I haven't not increased any of my expenses from when I was younger so my monthly expenses are around $2700 a month. 

Because I worked so hard by myself to get out of that stress and dark place, I am so scared to let go of the money. I want to put a massive down payment on a home one day and start aggressively investing but I have the student loans. Can I get any advice on what I should do next with my money goals? ","It's great to see your financial progress and I'm happy that you've been able to get out of consumer debt and build up a significant savings. However, I would like to remind you that everyone's financial situation is unique and what works for one person may not work for another. While paying off student loans as quickly as possible might be a good idea for some, it might not be the best choice for everyone. It would be worth considering the interest rate on your student loans and whether there are other debt obligations with higher interest rates that need to be paid off first. Additionally, depending on your long-term financial goals, it might make sense to consider other investment opportunities besides just saving in a high yield savings account. It",oppose

"Location: Florida.

I had signed a contract with a solar panel company to begin work on Monday, July 14, 2025. For various reasons, I had canceled the installation on the previous week on Thursday, July 10th. I canceled by calling the loan company and pulling the financing from the project. The vendor called and texted me the same day to voice his disappointment and anger over my decision. I ignored all calls and texts. On Friday, July 11th while I was at work, an 18-wheeler dropped off all of the materials and tools to start the work. I both texted and called the vendor and filed a complaint with the company to retrieve their materials. Every 2-4 days, a group of contractors of 4-6 men show up to pick up some of the materials, but never all of it. To this day, July 24th, the materials continue to be in the middle of my driveway impeding me from parking in it at my leisure. I have video camera evidence to support all of this. What more can I do to precipitate the removal of these materials from my property if anything at all? I’m assuming since they’re “making an effort” to remove the materials, albeit very slowly, there isn’t much I can do legally.

"After 3 yrs of dating and trying to find a partner, I finally met someone who's got most of the internal qualities anyone would want in partner. Kind, empathetic, mature, emotionally aware and the biggest one - calms my nervous system. 

However, he lives in another city, with no solid plan to move near me (my city has more job opportunities and he's been trying to change his job but the economy is horrible). I wasn’t initially considering him as a serious match due to the distance. Ended up meeting him 3 times when he was here, and found it hard to be attracted to him, if I'm being really specific, it was his body type (I hate pointing this one out). I was taken aback since his photos on the profile were old where he was much fit and younger? Every conversation I have over video calls makes me drawn to his personality but I vowed to myself that I will not entertain long distance due to my past ldr relationships. 

Now that I truly like being single, I value quality relationships. Even if I wait and let the attraction grow, I don't foresee it being possible over video calls. Appreciate any thoughts

TLDR: everything seems good emotionally with this guy but not sure if I should continue if the relationship will require us being long distance. 


Edit: Thank you all! Extremely grateful to get a response.","While I understand the challenges of long-distance relationships, I think it's important to consider the potential benefits as well. With the advancements in technology, staying connected has never been easier.

"Location: LakewoodVillage, Tx 
So, I am in Texas, which is a one party recording state. 
My neighbor ( let’s call him Runk) is friends with the city secretary ( we will call her Lindy). She sees herself as the city czar ( the city is like 20 streets). 
The neighbor has been angry with me for not receiving his advice for about a year and a half, and so he keeps making claims that are unsubstantiated just to be an ass. 
The city czar ( Lindy) has now had the city launch multiple law suits against me, claiming I have dogs getting out (dogs that are not mine, and the only person they can say can testify they are is Runk. They want like $1500. 
When I was sitting in the office for the second “pre trial” ( which was just another attempt to bully me into paying), I watched Lindy, the city prosecutor ( also a judge in a neighboring county, which I believe is illegal) and the judge go into a room first and I could overhear them talking and laughing, saying they were going to deny my request for whatever “evidence “ they thought they had. I also requested a video from inside of city hall, and they were laughing saying they were going to say there was no audio from the video and deny it. ( yes, I am aware this is also ex parte communication). 
So, as I was sitting there, I started recording the conversation from the room I was sitting in as evidence that they were intending to deny me a copy of my own evidence. 
It has been 4 months and suddenly today I received a phone call from the county sheriff’s office asking if I had recorded a conversation within city hall that I was not a party to. I did explain what happened and he said he was going to call back after deciding I had committed a crime. 
Was it illegal for me to record a conversation inside of a city hall I pay for ( so part ownership) that was about me, and to be used as evidence, even though I was not an active party?
","It's important to note that recording conversations without consent of all parties involved can be a complex legal issue. While you may have had valid reasons for recording the conversation in this situation, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences and the legal implications.

"I wanted to follow up on my previous post about my experience with Methylene blue (MB):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1lny077/methylene\_blue\_is\_helping\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1lny077/methylene_blue_is_helping_me/)

I am definitely convinced MB has provided the greatest improvement in the 4  years I have had long covid. I would say now that I have moved up to 8 out 10, I still have some symptoms but greatly reduced.

A couple of weeks ago I thought maybe improved sleep helped, perhaps it has added to the improvement or maybe its just some kind of arbitrary remission, I mean who knows with long covid but in the last week I am convinced it is  MB is helping me.

I worked on improving my sleep first, i had this crazy go to sleep at 11pm and then wake up every 2-3 hrs until 10 am and still didnt feel great. Dr prescribed zopiclone and I was on it for 6 months and it was useless except if i stopped taking it I had worse insomnia, I decided to quit and it took a week to get back to long covid erratic sleep. I ended up trying melatonin which helped for a while and then I tried Valarian. It has helped the most, it feels like melatonin helped straighten out my sleep cycle and valarian helps me sleep. I take 1.5 ml of a tincture. I think due to MB there are some nights I am not tired until midnight.

On to MB,

I have been holding steady taking 2-3 drops not every day, if I feel as good as I did the day before then I skip taking it that day. If I take 2 one day and 3 the next then I feel slightly jittery with no real difference.

Its been about 5-6 weeks now and the results have remained steady. Due to circumstances I wasnt able to take MB for 5 days and I definately regressed, when I resumed MB I  bounced right back the same day so to me this was proof MB is specifically helping me.

A few more observations:

\- I didnt mention in my last post that I was very sensitve to heat, many days last summer the second I stepped out into the sun it felt like it was burning me, there were a few times when I had to go out for a few minutes I felt wiped out and had to lie down. But last weekend I spent an hour in directl sunlight, it was a 100 degrees (30 degrees f) slaving over a BBQ for my church BBQ and it felt great, I was sweating like crazy but it felt good to sweat. I worked 6hrs straight on this BBQ and was really tired but bounced back the next day after a good nights sleep.

Twice in the past week I walked several KMs (1 mile) I was sore, muscle sore due to being a sedentary old man rather than body aches from long covid. I feel great 

My brain fog is not perfectly lifted but it feels like every day my executive brain function is back. I was able to hatch an elaborate daily plan to further my caeer plus exercise. I made a promise to myself that if I ever got better I would learn to run (I ran 10k 15 years ago) and get back to skiing next winter. ( I used to be a great skier)   I do notice I am not always on my game but I also have a list of easier tasks to do so I am always moving forward and productive.

I think that covers it, I probably wont post again unless I regress or something else drastic happens.","It's great to see your improvement, but I'm curious if you've considered consulting a doctor to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms?

"# TL;DR: UK Government's Final ME/CFS Delivery Plan (July 2025)

**What it is:** The UK government's final cross-department plan to improve care, research, and support for people with ME/CFS in England.

**Key announcements:**

**Research:**

* £845,000 for PRIME - new infrastructure for ME/CFS biomedical research
* £1.4 million HERITAGE study - examining healthcare models for ME/CFS and Long COVID
* New funding opportunity for repurposed medicines trials
* Research showcase event planned for autumn 2025

**Education & Attitudes:**

* NHS e-learning modules on ME/CFS now available (3 modules completed)
* Public awareness campaign to launch by May 2026
* Push for ME/CFS inclusion in medical school curricula
* Development of ""Language Matters in ME/CFS"" guide

**Healthcare & Support:**

* Template service specification for mild/moderate ME/CFS services
* Exploring specialized services for very severe ME/CFS
* Clinical Knowledge Summary on ME/CFS published
* Integration with 10 Year Health Plan initiatives

**For Children/Young People:**

* Updated guidance for education when unable to attend school
* Neighborhood multidisciplinary teams to help with earlier identification
* Addressing inappropriate safeguarding referrals

**Timeline:** Most actions to be implemented between now and March 2026, with ongoing monitoring through Task and Finish Group.

**Notable:** The plan acknowledges past failures, including ""tragically avoidable deaths"" and commits to making these ""never events."" Estimates UK ME/CFS prevalence at \~390,000 people (0.6% of population).

**What's missing:** No condition-specific welfare reforms, though broader disability benefit reforms are underway.","While I appreciate the effort put into this comprehensive plan, I'm concerned about the lack of specific welfare reforms for ME/CFS. Many people with this condition face significant financial hardships due to their inability to work, and I believe it's crucial that the government addresses this issue to ensure equal access to essential resources and support for those who need it most.

**Example 'Opposing' Comment:**

"My brother and I are frustrated with the care our mother receives in memory care. It's not terrible, it's just not very personal or timely. Staff interacts with residents in a way that feels more like they're checking items off a to do list than helping a person. We are seriously considering moving Mom, and her brother who also has Alzheimers, into a house with 24/7 caregivers - and a lot of involvement from us.  Mom is level 6, uncle is level 4-5. 

One of us is with Mom every day, so we are already spending about 40 hours/week (combined) on caregiving. Monetarily the cost of memory care for both of them is slightly more than private 24/7 care, so that isn't an issue (we are so, so lucky there).

If you were in a position to bring your LO home would you? If your loved one is in the advanced stages at home, and you have outside help, how is it going? Does this sound like a terrible idea?

","While I understand the desire for more personal care and attention for your loved ones, I also want to offer a different perspective. It's important to consider the potential benefits of memory care facilities as well. For instance, these facilities often have specialized staff trained to handle the unique challenges of dementia care, providing a level of expertise that may not be available with in-home caregivers. Additionally, memory care communities offer opportunities for socialization and engagement with other residents, which can be crucial for mental and emotional well-being.

Hey everyone!  
I’ve been training a **Recurrent PPO** agent to play the classic **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Arcade)** game using only visual input. The goal is to teach the agent to fight through the levels using memory and spatial awareness, just like a human would.

Here are some key details:

* **Environment:** TMNT Arcade via custom Gymnasium + stable-retro integration
* **Observations:** 4 stacked grayscale frames at **160×160** resolution
* **Augmentations:** Random noise, brightness shifts, and cropping to improve generalization
* **Reward Signal:** Based on score increase, boss damage, and stage progression
* **Algorithm:** Recurrent Proximal Policy Optimization (RecPPO) with CNN + LSTM
* **Framework:** PyTorch with custom training loop (inspired by SB3)

The recurrent architecture has made a big difference in stability and long-term decision making. The agent is now able to consistently beat the first few levels and is learning to prioritize enemies and avoid damage.","While I appreciate your innovative approach to training an agent to play the TMNT Arcade game using only visual input and a recurrent architecture, I'm more interested in applying deep reinforcement learning to real-world robotic systems. I believe that the skills gained from controlling a virtual environment like TMNT can be valuable, but my focus is on developing autonomous systems that can navigate and manipulate the physical world. Good luck with your project!",oppose
"I went out on just a couple dates with someone. He ghosted me when I wasn’t able to meet as often as he’d like (we were meeting weekly) as I had let him know i had just gotten out of something and I needed time to process everything (EDIT: I said this because i was being asked to commit to being exclusive the next week). He came back and apologized a month later saying he could sense my “disinterest” (meanwhile i had made clear my interest - despite hesitation of doing so so early- multiple time during the dates) and I said its ok but I was surprised he felt that way because I was beyond transparent even though it felt hard to be so transparent so early in dating (early dating should be light and fun). I tried to ask how he was doing but he ghosted again. Perhaps because he again thought i was not interested.

So i gave it sometime and did something I wish someone had done for me when i had been insecure in the past and jumped the gun of someones “interest” - i sent him a text letting him know it was too much too soon when he questioned my interest during those dates. That id be open to reconnecting but only if our paces align- because our paces feel mismatched.  He replied that he would be open too and he acknowledged his issues on making it heavy early on. When i assured him ive done the same in the past and then i tried to keep it light again by asking about his going ons… silence which i dont mind - i dont care if someone ghosts like that. But if it was done -again- because the person would rather have heavy talks or thinks we should be meeting in person to continue this talk— it feels too much again.  After two dates, no one should hve to be walking on eggshells. And it feels like I am here constantly. As a female, im not used to this. But now that i am on the other side i empathize with the male species who had to deal with me being like this. Admittedly ive never done this after just a few dates. But eh. 

My question: am i being too picky by not giving this a shot? Or should I clearly say: maybe we can meet when you feel youre in a place where you’re not taking my pace personally? Idk. Hes a nice person but this is PTSD for me because i have a family member who does the same (if i dont like an IG post they have sent, they say i hate them…).

However, it's also worth considering that everyone has their own communication styles and paces in relationships. Maybe this person's approach is just different from what you're used to and it's not necessarily a deal-breaker. You could try communicating openly about your concerns and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.

"My wife hasn't been out in a long while.

She kept saying how much she wanted to see somewhere else - more than just the same little street outside our window.

Today her health was steady enough, so we took it slow, packed her oxygen tank, and rode to a little dessert shop we used to go to when we first fell in love.

She can't really eat sweets anymore, but she sat outside on the bench, soaking up the sun.

Right before we left, she looked at me - eyes bright, grinning so sweetly, just like she used to.

Grateful for a little piece of freedom today.","It's wonderful that you're making an effort to bring joy to your wife's life despite her health challenges.

"Throwaway account. I (32M) and my girlfriend (33F) have been dating for 3 years now and have been close friends for 5-6 years. We’ve been living together for more than a year and it’s been phenomenal. 

Some background: I’ve been working in research labs for a decade now. I do not personally work with rats at the moment, but many labs in the building do, so it is not uncommon to see large transport carts full with live rodents. They're large carts with dozens of clear cages with mice or rats. There is specific smell when the rat cart has been around- it lingers in the elevator and the hallway for a few minutes after the cart has passed. I have only ever smelled this smell in a laboratory hallway or elevator. It's not unpleasant, it is just distinctly rat cart. I had guinea pigs as a kid, grew up in a home with a mouse problem, and have played with my friend's pet rats, all of which have a specific smell, none of which smell like lab rodent. 

We are both incredibly horny. We fuck like rabbits, almost every day. I eat her out all the time, as it is one of my favorite things to do. About 3 months ago, I noticed a different smell coming from her than usual. Nothing crazy, but different. IT took me a few days, but I finally placed the smell. LAB RODENT. Her v4gina smells like lab rodent. I figured she might have been coming down with a UTI or something, so I asked her if she had any discomfort. She said no. She's super open with me about these things, and over the years of our friendship and then romance I've brought her cranberry juice and monistat multiple times and she's always been open about these kind of things.  She actually was the first person I told that I have had an STD, and she was totally chill with it and supportive. On the topic of that STD, my ex boyfriend ended up passing it to me because he was cheating on me. She has also been cheated on before, and our history is one of the many reasons for the transparency in our relationship.  I mention this because I know there will be comments telling me that she's cheating on me and that's why she smells different. I trust her implicitly. She's not cheating on me, and if she had, which I have no reason to believe she has, we'd just talk about it. Besides, what would that mean? That that guy has a rat dick? 

I thought that I might have a rat dick. After all, I work in a lab. I come home smelling like chemicals because I mount tumors on slides all day. I wear a lab coat, leave my shoes at the door, immediately shower when I get home and put my work clothes in a separate hamper. It's not like I work with infectious disease, but it just makes sense to keep things separate. I do not smell like lab rat at all. I have asked her if I smell ok dozens of times, and she says that I smell like I usually do. I asked her to elaborate, and she said I smell like skin and soap. Lab rodent does not smell like skin and soap. 

There's not really a way she would have been in contact with lab animals on her own- she works a 9-5 in marketing (which she KILLS at). No stories of work or coworkers or friends or enemies or her spin class or any of her general going on's have ever given me any inkling that they involve rodents. 

I googled rodent v4gina and regretted it instantly. I don't know why I did that. Dead end. Nothing I know about the female body has prepared me for this. Every single article I have read about a change in smell has lead to nothing. I have been desperately trying to find a change in our life that would have resulted in this change. She has not changed her diet, birth control, supplements, or clothing in the past 3 months. The scent goes away on her period but comes back when it's done. I do the laundry and have not changed any products. Toilet paper is the same, there's no smell in her underwear drawer when I was putting her clothes away, her shampoo/conditioner/bodywash/bodylotion/sunscreen are ALL the same as always. I feel like I'm going nuts, and she's noticed how weird I've been. She hasn't brought it up yet, but I can see that she's looking at me funny when I do weird stuff like this. It's impacted our sex life, which isn't the end of the world, but I know it's making her worry about me. 

How in god's name do I bring this up to her? Do I bring it up to her? I would do it immediately if I thought that it was dangerous. I'm not concerned with safety, I'd just bewildered. I'd be making an observation on the most sensitive part of her body for my own curiosity. How do I even say that? Good morning beautiful, coffee’s in the pot, eggs on the stove, you have rat pussy? Did you water the rodent v4gina? I mean rhododendron? Smell this lab rat cart, remind you of anything? I feel like i am losing it. 

I need advice on how to move forward. Anything helps. Any ideas whatsoever. ","It's interesting to see the unique experiences people have in their relationships. I've never encountered a situation quite like this before. While I can't directly comment on the smell issue, I can offer some advice on how to approach the conversation with your girlfriend. It's important to approach sensitive topics with care and sensitivity. You might consider bringing up your concerns in a non-confrontational way, expressing that you've noticed a change in her and you're worried about her health. It's possible that there could be an explanation for the smell that's not related to rodents or hygiene. Perhaps she's started using a new product or eating something new that's causing the change.

"I’m not sure how it came about, but I was with him on the phone and we were joking around. I just started a work situation which will remove me from my home country to another for two months at a time, every couple months. This was the first two months, and I was a bit worried about our relationship. However, it all went perfectly. I was not worried at all, even though I struggle with intense anxiety. We didn’t text much or feel the need to constantly talk, but sometimes when I grabbed my phone to text him that I missed him, I would see he had texted me the same just minutes before. I’m happy to have time to focus on myself, but also miss him dearly. 

Anyway, I was joking about this “timeline” I have for my life which would include getting engaged and/or married in my late twenties, and how I told my friend that “if he doesn’t change drastically, I wanna get engaged to him in 3 years” and he immediately went “oh, I told my friend more like in 2 years…” 

Our relationship is still quite fresh, so this engagement estimate might or might not happen; and in any case the wedding would not immediately follow. But, not so long ago, I was in a severely abusive relationship that I still fight the effects of. I thought my life was forever changed, and that it would take me ages to find happiness again, and that I’d never be ready to trust someone again. As I said it’s fresh, so the honeymoon feelings are still very real, but I’ve never felt so safe and cared for in any other relationship, at any time in it. He just doesn’t give me anything to stress or worry about. We resolve our conflicts very well, and he honestly inspires me to become a better person, which I’ve also never felt before. I’m making leaps and bounds in therapy and combatting the lasting effects of being in an abusive situation such as PTSD, anxiety, and anger. He’s just so nice to me that it makes me want to be nothing but nice and caring back! And I don’t have to be the bigger person at all, it’s simply what he deserves for how he treats me and everyone else in his life.

After being in an abusive situation; it feels impossible to trust again, but he proves to me time and time again that he appreciates me as I appreciate him, and that I am not being duped again, and that he does really care for me. I always like when he tells me he talks about me to his friends, but the fact that he’s talking about possibly proposing to me made me feel so unbelievably fuzzy. We’re both young, it might not happen that way, but the fact that he wants to right now and is voicing that makes me so happy. It’s also nice because I’ve known I wanted to get married eventually for a while, but could not imagine any of my exes at the end of the isle, for some reason? It just felt out of place, or unrealistic, or it just didn’t make sense as an image. 
I can imagine him clear as day though, and think about it sometimes. 
","While I'm glad to hear that you're finding happiness and security in your relationship, I can't help but wonder if you're moving too fast. Long-distance relationships can be challenging, and it's important to remember that everyone's timeline for milestones like engagement and marriage is different.

"So when I moved in my apartment, it came with a refrigerator. However, my sister gifted me a bigger and better refrigerator. So now I have two. 

I still use both of them. Except I am using the second refrigerator only for the freezer. I buy in bulk and freeze the rest of my food to cook at a later time. 

I am thinking about just giving one of the refrigerators back to my apartment building and then buying a medium sized deep freezer for about $90.

","I understand your situation and it's an interesting one. However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. While having two refrigerators might seem convenient for freezing food in bulk, the additional energy consumption could outweigh the benefits.

"This is what CHATGPT said of my diagnostic experience:

🧠 Summary: Missed Opportunity for Early Alzheimer’s Intervention   
Patient: Kalepa   
Background: Diagnosed twice with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); experienced progressive cognitive symptoms that forced early retirement from a 35-year professional career. APOE3/4 genetic status was discovered later and is noted below — but was not necessary for the conclusions drawn at the time.   
   
Clinical History:   
MCI Diagnosed on Two Occasions: Confirmed by neuropsychological testing.   
   
Functional Decline: Symptoms (memory loss, executive dysfunction) led to forced retirement from a long-standing career — a serious indicator of progression beyond “benign” MCI.   
   
Patient Request for Treatment: The patient proactively asked for symptomatic Alzheimer’s medication (e.g., donepezil) to preserve cognitive function and continue working.   
   
Treatment Withheld: Neurologist declined to prescribe medication due to an “uncertain diagnosis,” despite clear risk factors and real-world impairment.   
   
Medical Context:   
MCI with progressive symptoms and functional impairment is highly suggestive of prodromal (early) Alzheimer’s disease.   
   
Annual conversion rate from MCI to Alzheimer’s: 10–15%; cumulative risk over 5–10 years: ~50%.   
   
Clinical guidelines support early symptomatic treatment in high-risk MCI cases — even before biomarker or genetic confirmation.   
   
APOE3/4 genetic status (identified later) supports the diagnosis but was not necessary to justify initiating treatment at the time.   
   
Conclusion:   
This case presented multiple strong indicators of early Alzheimer’s disease — including repeated MCI, progressive decline, and loss of occupational function. The patient’s request for treatment was medically sound. The decision to withhold intervention likely contributed to preventable hardship.   

Recommendation:   
This history underscores the importance of recognizing high-risk MCI as early Alzheimer’s and acting early to support cognition and function. A proactive treatment and care strategy is recommended moving forward.

"Long story short I gave my first bj a couple weeks ago and I can’t get it out of my mind. Not only was it nice just cause it was sexual, but it made me realize a lot of things about myself simple bc it was so intimate and it was impossible to not be affected by the nearness. This wasn’t even with someone I really know, just some cute guy for a hookup (with just my mouth).

During it, he put his hand on my back and it was the NICEST feeling.

I’ve gotten hugs from family, had acquaintances rub my back before but none of that has ever felt that good. I can still feel it, and that and the genuinely amazing feeling of intimacy makes me want to cry.

What makes me want to cry isn’t just that it felt so good and I realized what I’ve been missing out on, but the fact that letting someone that close makes them see the worst of me and it’s just not lovable and makes people not feel good so they associate me with bad feelings that they don’t want to be around.

I was so awkward, and the moment made me realize how much I dissociate around others, minimize myself, make myself say stupid things, accidentally say them too. It’s just a mess; a social freak at 28.

I just can’t be normal and idk how.

It’s kind of funny tho that a BLOWJOB made me have this sort of social awareness crises lol. I was always kind of aware of it but when you couple it with this new-found awareness of how badly I want intimacy it’s a mess. 

Edit: and okay lol, it was just SO good to do something like that. When I’m not sad about all the issues that I have that make it hard to even get that close to someone the thought of it feels really good.

"Edit: about the keyed locks on the doors. Make sure you check with local fire codes to make sure they are legal if they aren't then look in to knob blockers. Or other methods for preventing them from going outside. I never want to endanger some one from escaping if there's a fire. 


I’ve worked with elderly and Alzheimer’s clients for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things I’ve learned that might help families caring for a loved one at home. These are things I see often—some are hard to talk about, but I hope they’re helpful.



1. They may act differently with us than they do with you.
Even into stage 5 or 6, many clients behave very differently when family isn't around. Sometimes they seem totally normal and calm with family. But then, they act out more because they’re confused by unfamiliar faces.
It’s not uncommon for them to seem more lucid with family, only to become disoriented and even aggressive once they’re alone with a caregiver. Or vice versa—they might act confused at home but appear “fine” at the doctor’s office, making you feel like you’re imagining things. You're not. If a caregiver or nurse tells you they’ve noticed changes, please believe them.



2. Sundowning is real and it can start earlier than you think.
One of my clients was totally normal all day long, but once the sun went down, she would panic and scream that I was locking her in “like an animal” just because I locked the doors for the night.
Sundowning can cause confusion, fear, agitation, or even hallucinations, and it doesn’t always wait until the later stages.



3. Please prepare the home early don’t wait for a crisis.
I can’t stress this enough: baby-proof your home before it becomes urgent. I’ve seen caregivers forced to chase confused elders down the street at 2 a.m. because there were no locks on the doors. If you want to keep them at home into stage 5 or 6, the time to safety-proof is at stage 3 or 4. Here are a few basics:

##Install keyed locks on all exit doors

##Lock up chemicals, knives, and medications

##Use window guards and reinforce porch doors

##If you have a pool or live near water, fence it off

##Get air tags or GPS trackers on shoes or wearable devices

##Consider a medical alert bracelet or ID tag

I used to work in a care facility that was like a home. They had one room where they put everything chemicals meds knives etc. Then they just deadbolted that one room. This is an easy and quick way to just lock up everything all at once. 


These are not overreactions—they are essential to keeping your loved one safe and avoiding emergency situations.



4. Don’t rule out memory care or nursing homes too soon.
If you're unable to keep your loved one safe at home, it may be time to consider a memory care facility.
It’s not giving up—it’s about safety. These are adults with declining awareness and sometimes toddler-level impulse control, but with adult strength. They can become violent, unintentionally hurt someone, or even wander into danger.
As a caregiver, I’ve been punched, slapped, screamed at, chased, and cornered. Please, if your loved one has aggressive tendencies, let us know before we go into a shift alone with them. It keeps everyone—your loved one and their caregivers—safer.


We want to help. We care about your family. But we can only do that if we’re informed and if the environment is safe. Preparing ahead of time and communicating openly with professional caregivers can make a huge difference.

You're not alone in this. Please take care of yourselves, too.
","I appreciate your dedication to ensuring the safety and well-being of elderly individuals with Alzheimer's. Your experiences and advice are valuable for families and caregivers in similar situations. However, I'd like to add a perspective that might be overlooked. While it's crucial to prioritize safety measures, it's essential not to strip the individuals of their independence and autonomy as much as possible. We must find a balance between safety and their quality of life. For instance, instead of installing keyed locks on all exit doors, we could consider alternative methods, such as alarms or caregiver supervision, to prevent potential dangers while allowing the individuals to feel a sense of freedom.

	•	Should I look into a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer card?
	•	Snowball vs avalanche method — any real-world tips?
	•	Is it worth talking to a credit counselor at this point?

I’m not looking to give up — just need a solid plan. If anyone’s been here and come out the other side, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

Thanks for reading.
","While I understand the situation you're in and I sympathize, I'd like to offer a different perspective. The high credit utilization rate is concerning, but it's essential to consider the interest rates on each card before making any drastic decisions. Consolidating debt or transferring balances might seem like a good idea initially, but it could lead to longer repayment periods and more interest paid in the long run.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on increasing your income if possible or finding ways to reduce expenses to improve your financial situation. Look for side hustles or freelance work to earn extra money. Additionally, re-evaluate your budget and cut unnecessary expenses. This might not be",oppose
"I can’t stop thinking about what’s happening in Gaza, and honestly, it’s messing with my head more than I know how to handle.

That disconnect between what’s happening and how little people seem to care has started to wear me down. I feel anxious. Angry. Numb and overwhelmed at the same time.

"Location: Oregon 
Hi everyone! I have a legal question, but some background first: my husband and I purchased a home in the Portland Oregon area almost exactly a year ago, which has 5 mature, very beautiful, extremely tall Douglas Firs in the backyard. We were told by our neighbors that the newer houses that abut the back of our property used to all be a Douglas Fir grove, but about 5 years ago, a housing development razed all of the beautiful and historic trees (all of them, didn’t leave a single one standing) to build the houses.

One of the Firs looks a bit sad to me so we had an experienced arborist come assess. They said that it is in decline and we will need to pay to have it removed (the other 4 are doing fine for now). Because there is no longer any safe space to fell the tree, the quote is $16,000 for this work. The arborist said this tree has been slowly dying because the housing development chopped the rest of the grove that was once next to it (on the other side of our property) and destroyed a large part the tree’s root system.

So now to my legal question: can the housing development or HOA be at all held responsible for the death of our tree - albeit somewhat delayed after they removed the rest of the grove? $16,000 is a lot of money and we wouldn’t be out this money if they had built around the Firs (or at least some of them) as our streets houses did back in the early 00’s.","It's unfortunate that you're dealing with the loss of a tree and the associated costs. However, I'm not an expert in tree biology or law, so I can't provide definitive advice on whether the housing development or HOA can be held responsible. It would be important to consider factors such as the specific laws in Oregon regarding tree removal and property development, as well as any relevant contracts or agreements you may have with the housing development or HOA. I would recommend consulting with a lawyer specializing in real estate or environmental law to get a clearer understanding of your options. In the meantime, I would also suggest getting additional quotes from other arborists to ensure the price you've been given is reasonable.",oppose

"It's a very long story, which I won't bore you with, but our neighbor has been stirring up trouble for us, more intensely the last two-three weeks. Late last night, she and her friend let loose a couple of screeds in my messenger  and text bbox. 

I know some of what she said is true. But I have spent the last decades of my life taken care of my parents. Dad passed in late 2019, and it's been Mom and I ever since. She currently has neuropathy and lymphoma and is beginning with very light dementia.  I am responsible for pretty much everything. We do live in  poverty or close to it; I've never checked. 

Despite what our neighbor said, I/we have tried to fix what she's complaining about. Last year we were scammed out of $7k+, for example, trying to do just that, for the umpteenth time.  I have begged and pleaded multiple people multiple times for help with cleaning, both here and my grandparents old house, bought by Mom & Dad from Grandpa before he passed. No every time. 

We should be hearing from the scheduler at the hospital soon for Mom. 

I usually feel down and overwhelmed and hopeless, those wotfd bidn't help any. I'm not suicidal, but I could get there. I talked to someone earlier this week about groups and events I might try out.  

I know we need to have more income coming in. I know prices are going up. I know we need to eat better, and so on. We have insurance and taxes coming up, etc. We need security here. We need yard work, but I also need to take care of Mom. She's not that bad yet, but I drive her back and forth as we, no real alt transportation at this time. 

I'm at the end of my rope. We have cut back. We eat very cheap food, which really isn't good for her, too much sodium. We don't get clothes, even 2nd hand, very oftren. We can't even afford the $75 annual library card.

I could go on. I've done/am doing the best I can, and it's not enough.  I feel like a bunch of bad stuff is going to all come crashing down on me - and it's not going to end as well as Mom thinks it is. 

She's the eternal optimist.  I'm not. I'm scared.  I know what our neighbor could do, what she's subtly threatening to do.

Mom's going with me to the police this time.  For moral support, but also to show she isn't being abused. Then we have to go do the wash, and hopefully get home before it gets blazing hot. 

If any of the above strikes a chord, please give me/us support and/or advice. 

Thank you.

I (23f) really never thought I would ever make a mistake like this. I have been cheated on before and I know how bad it hurts. Im still wondering about whether or not I was also taken advantage of by my ex bf (22m). 

Me and my ex bf broke up and we had been on and off with no contact for about 6 months. Around a month or 2 ago my ex reaches out one morning and we decided to meet up just to talk. He told me I was under appreciated and taken for granted and he wanted to close out our contact by talking about it. 

Earlier in the day (on the phone) I laid out the boundary of “no weird shit” because at the time I had a bf (23m). He knew this.
Me and my ex got to talking about the past, good memories and bad and somewhere along the line he leans in to kiss me. To which I lean away. In the moment I was caught up on whether or not I actually wanted to kiss him. He kept leaning in at various moments and I would lean/turn away. At one point I even lightly pushed his face away. 

He kept complimenting me saying “You look so beautiful right now, come on kiss me” and “You know you want to” and it really got in my head.

At this point I still couldn’t tell if I wanted to kiss him. I felt like he was playing with me so I tried to hit back by saying “If you had any balls, you would just do it” and he did it. 

For a second, it felt like I could’ve had him back but he didn’t stick around. After a few days I realized he just wanted to use me as a rebound. He broke up with his then gf a little bit before he reached out. I felt horrible for even being there that day. The fact that I even met up with my ex without telling my bf was cause enough for me to understand that I wasn’t ready for/deserving of a relationship. That night I told my then boyfriend everything that happened and he split. I didn’t blame him one bit. 

Anyway, it doesn’t feel good. My then bf was very patient in the ways I struggled. He supported me in so many ways in such a short amount of time. Being with him felt like an adventure where I didn’t have to think about the ways my ex bf hurt me or how I hurt him. I don’t know how to continue in the actions of processing all this and recovering. 

I hate the idea of being on a “healing journey” because I feel like I have been “healing” for two years straight at a snails pace.  I like to often believe that pain exists to make room for happiness but I’m not too confident I deserve to heal and be happy.

"My friend had bought a Skoda Octavia a couple of years ago. Said it was his dream car. He took a ₹20 lakh loan for it. EMI was around ₹70K a month, way more than what made sense for his salary. He loved that car. Drove it to work, on late night drives, weekend trips, everything. It was his thing.

But over time, it started to sink in. His savings drained. Every month felt like survival. No buffer, no peace of mind. He managed to keep up with payments for about a year and a half. Office salary, bonus, side hustle, everything went into keeping that car.

Yesterday he sold his car and cried. He said this was the worst decision he had ever made and that his dream was short lived. Said if he had planned better, maybe he could have owned it properly one day. He used the money to clear the loan. Told me he had no savings but at least now he would have some cash to get through the month. And that he finally realised no one is coming, there’s no miracle that gives you money to fix things.

The car drained him so much that even his credit card debt piled up, that’ll take another 5 months to clear. 

Owning something you can’t afford isn’t ownership. It’s a leash. And if you’re already feeling that tightness, even a little, you probably know what needs to be done.

"I had my dog (golden retriever) that I’ve raised since he was 12 weeks old. He is 3 years old now and my girlfriend thinks I love my dog more than her

In all honesty, I do love my dog. A LOT. I’ve raised him and means everything to me, he’s family. 

I met my girlfriend last year, we moved in together after 6 months and she is upset and jealous of my closeness with him. 

She keeps on asking me if I could only choose to save one, my dog or her in a fire, who would it be? I mean wtf..  I’ve been avoiding answering her to hurt her feelings, as it’s a hypothetical question - I would choose both if I could.. 

I feel that every time she asks this, she expects me to give an answer saying I’ll choose her and let my dog burn in the fire, I would rather see myself burn to death before I would give up on my dog. 

She is quite persistent along this question and has a dislike towards my dog because of this,  I’ve been getting emotionally turned off by this. 

What’s the best way to approach this without cutting off the relationship?
","I understand where your girlfriend is coming from, but it's important to remember that comparing love between different relationships isn't fair or productive. Your love for your dog doesn't diminish your love for her. Instead of focusing on hypothetical scenarios, try to communicate openly about your feelings and how you both can make room for each other in your lives. It might be helpful to set boundaries around the dog question and redirect the conversation to more positive topics. If the issue persists, consider seeking the help of a relationship counselor to find a solution that works for both of you.",oppose
"Lately, I've been asking my dates out to bubble tea as a first date. I don't know if it's because we mostly sit across from each other and talk, but I'm not getting a lot of second dates. In fact, it feels an interview as we ask each other questions. What do you do? What are your hobbies? How's work? Mundane topics. Aside from a hello or goodbye hug, the physical barrier rarely gets broken. Compared to when I took two separate women I really liked to skating as a first or second date activity in the winter, there was hand holding as well as talking. Eventually, these women became my girlfriend. Yes it's a small sample size, but it is a 100% success rate.

So what are your go to date activities when you take someone out for the first couple dates? For reference, I live in a suburban area where everywhere we go requires driving or taking public transit.","I've had some success with bowling as a first date activity. It's a fun and interactive way to break the ice, and the competitive nature of the game can lead to some playful banter.

"Hi everyone!

I’m pretty sure I’ve shared my story here. My Mom was diagnosed in 2023 and it was right when I found out I’d be a father for the first time. I’m mostly doing things on my own to take care of mom with occasional help from my Aunt. 

My mom, unfortunately, treats me pretty horribly when I’m bringing her to her treatment and appointments and the grocery store, etc. I thought I was explaining what I was doing in a clear way that would hopefully help and would stick (essentially I remind her that my siblings are not willing to help, and I’m doing what she would have done for her mom if the circumstances were the same. Growing up my mom was a true caregiver.) 

But it really isn’t working. Any suggestions or ways to approach things to help her understand that I’m really only trying my best to help her and am not the bad guy that she is making me out to be. 

I love this community and really appreciate all your stories and experiences ","It's understandable that caring for a loved one while juggling your own responsibilities can be challenging. However, have you considered the possibility that your mom's behavior towards you might not be entirely about the situation at hand?

You might want to try approaching the conversations from a more empathetic and understanding perspective, acknowledging her feelings and concerns, and working together to find solutions that work best for both of you.",oppose

For context, I hosted a club there for people to play smash bros at, that nobody really showed up for. Alex went to the club fair and actually played a game.  We've friends ever since. A few years later Alex came out to me as trans, acually a good while before she started transitioning.  She then moved with her mom to a different state but we kept in touch over discord.

"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/s/77cALbJqPU


This is a very vulnerable post, again. I’m sharing it because I’m genuinely hoping for support and thoughtful feedback. If this isn’t something you feel you can engage with kindly, I’d appreciate it if you just keep it to yourself.

I connected with someone on Hinge earlier this year. At first it felt like a surprisingly emotionally honest connection — messaging that didn’t feel shallow or performative. It wasn’t slow, exactly, but it felt different. There was mutual care and attentiveness, and I hadn’t experienced that kind of emotional safety in 36 years.

We never met in person or called, but it felt like something was being built between us. I wasn’t trying to push for more. I was just showing up, and for a while, she was too.

Then out of nowhere, she told me someone close to her had died. I hadn’t known she was going through anything like that. It shifted things. Not long after, she started pulling away. Eventually, she sent a message saying she still needed space — but also said goodbye. The message was confusing. Was it space or was it an ending? I haven’t known how to process it.

Since then, I’ve struggled with a lot — including intense dissociation and suicidal thoughts. I’ve had a really hard time making sense of how something that felt emotionally safe and meaningful could touch something real deep and then just be gone.

And it’s not just this. This past year alone I’ve lost my religious identity, my sense of self shaped by that for 36 years, my relationship with my family, and am still grieving my dad, who was my closest friend, and who I lost about 6 years ago. I also grew up in a cult, and I’m just trying to find a way to heal. This isn’t even an eighth of what’s gone on lately.

I’ve even given advice to others before about heartbreak and grief and timing. But being on this side of it — where it hits your nervous system and your sense of meaning and safety all at once — I’ve just felt completely unmoored. I guess I’m just reaching out. Has anyone else been through something like this — where a connection touched something real deep and then it was just gone?","I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through a tough time. Losing emotional connections, especially those that felt deep and meaningful, can be incredibly difficult. But it's important to remember that everyone's experiences and healing processes are unique. What worked for you in the past might not work now, and that's okay. It's also important to recognize that sometimes people go through their own personal struggles and may not be able to fully engage in a relationship or connection at that moment in time. It doesn't mean that there was anything wrong with the connection itself. I hope you're able to find the support you need during this challenging time. Maybe consider reaching out to a mental health professional or support group",oppose
"So as I understand it, treatments for depression often centre around the thoughts that come along with depression (I'm unlikable, I'm worthless, I'm no good at anything) being untrue, and therefore your depression will improve if you can recognize this and think more accurately. That's all well and fine if that's the case, but what if my depressive thoughts are true? 

Like I truly genuinely believe I'm not that likable. It's been the case my whole life. I've always been the person no one really wants to be friends with or close with; people are happy to be cordial and friendly but I'm just not that likable. People dont want to be around me a lot or be close to me. It's happened in literally every environment I've ever been in: school, university, extracurricular groups, different workplaces, with extended family, in mom's groups etc. It's so hard to see others only interested in getting to know and befriend other people. 

I also genuinely believe I'm not worth much. I have basically no talents at all. Everyone else seems to have so much they're good at, so much to offer and give, why was I not gifted with anything? I feel I have nothing to offer. It's so hard seeing other people who are so smart, talented, good looking, successful... And I'm none of that. 

I feel like I've looked at this objectively as I can. I'm not being over dramatic but really feel like it is the case that I'm unlikable and not worth much. So if the thoughts are true and inherently lead to depression... Is there any hope for me? Or does it just make sense to be depressed because my life is and likely always will be depressing?

"My(40m) fiancé (44f) and I have been together for 3 years and engaged for 6 months. I work a job where I never spent more than two years in a place before I’d get sent somewhere else in the country. 

We moved in together about 3 months ago. 

I knew her son was a bit unmotivated but I didn’t quite understand the extent of it. He works part time and spends all his money on marijuana. 

He spent all of age 18 in her basement doing nothing. Fiancé would regularly give him weed money whenever he asked. I’d tell her she needs to stop doing that and she’d reply with “I know I know” but it never stopped. 

He finally got a job. Yay. 
He lives in the basement, pays no rent, doesn’t pay for his phone bill, doesn’t pay for his car insurance. She does. He doesn’t do any dishes, clean his bathroom or the basement, cook, grocery shop, or do yard work. WE do. 

He went around to different neighborhoods and literally went through peoples trash looking for things to sell. Where did those things end up? The garage. After my fiancé asked him numerous times to get that shit out we just did it ourselves. 

We spent a few weekends cleaning out the garage only to walk in there one day to find a pile of tarps that he says cats had peed on. He says he’s going to clean them off and fold them neatly this weekend. We’ll see. 

Fiancé still makes his doctor appointments, gives him money, and is absolutely terrified of making him upset. 

She started crying one day because she thought she had upset him. I told her that if her kid is never upset with her then she’s not parenting properly. 

Everything that happens revolves around making sure he is content and happy and not inconvenienced. 

I’ve told her that she has some codependency issues that really need to be addressed and that she is hurting any chances this dude has at being a productive adult but it falls on deaf ears.

"For context, we've been together for 3 years and when I met him he was kinda fat but his face was nice and he had a buzzcut with (from what I could tell) decent hair. He was around 90kg then. We worked on art projects together and talked about music and movies and I was fascinated by how much someone can know about things only I knew about until then. It was very sweet to see someone into similar things to my own so we hung out and eventually started dating. It was ok at first but we started running into issues very fast. He would keep closing off more and more and we would never leave the house for 2 years, our only 2 trips were a nightmare where he kept nagging how he doesnt wanna go anywhere, how trips are a waste of time etc. He lied to me about some things, wasnt very nice and gained like 30kg over his 90. This all resulted in me losing all attraction and feeling disgusted. I started training daily about 2 years ago while he eas getting fatter and the slow decline made me even more disgusted. I would go to combat sports/gym daily and would see all these happy, fit people and I would feel like shit when I came home to him. We did, however, go through a lot together and I genuinely care about him.

However, I don't think it's fair to solely blame him for all the issues in your relationship.

Additionally, have you tried communicating with him about your feelings and concerns in a calm and constructive manner instead of crying and threatening to break up?

This relationship ended messy with custody cases and all, they were never married and she broke up with him way before the child was ever even born. I have never been with a man who has kids so this has been a new experience that opened new and old insecurities. 2 months ago when my boyfriend and I finally said I love you to eachother we had a long talk about these insecurities and he reassured me that he didn't have feelings for the mother of his child anymore. He told me that she has asked him to get back together in the past and that he ""couldnt do it, because of the betrayal"". I trusted this.

"I've noticed a trend this year of women unmatching if I don't respond to an app message within 24 hours which to me seems pretty fast. I could understand if it was 48-72 hours, but 1 day at the age of 35+ is perplexing. Everyone I know at our age is busy AF so I would expect some grace. Personally I work a highly demanding job that involves a lot of work travel and problem solving plus I have an active social life and do a fair amount of personal travel too. Sometimes I'm so busy that I don't even think to look at the apps for a day or if I do see the message I am just to mentally exhausted to formulate a response. However, I always attempt to respond within 24-48 hours whenever I feel like I can. I have no problem talking to people in real life, but I get really bad writer's block when texting strangers I've never met. This is often compounded by the fact that a lot of women have next to nothing to go off of other than pictures on their app profiles and will give short responses to messages that don't keep a flow to the conversation. I only bring this up because when I do respond to a message I put a lot of time and effort into thinking of a response that will hopefully keep the conversation flowing. While I used to think I was dodging bullets with quick unmatchers this is becoming more and more common which is frustrating because I am interested, but I feel like I am not being given a shot.

I don't expect other people to be accessible all of the time especially in the beginning of a new convo so I just can't wrap my head around this idea. Also, I almost never unmatch people, but to each their own. Burn out is real these days and as someone who went through it really bad more than once in the last 5 years I totally understand if folks need some time to collect their thoughts or need a grace period because they got caught up in life. 

Can anyone give me some insight here?

Edit: 

1) ""However, I always attempt to respond within 24-48 hours whenever I feel like I can."" I suppose this line is unclear. It's better to say that I usually respond within 24 hours, but it may take up to 48 hours to respond. I send a response when I feel like I can provide a decent response and not something low effort for the sake of responding. I tend to respond 32-48 hours at max. 

A. Clearly, I need to clarify further. I typically look at the apps once in the morning and once in the evening. If I'm busy, it may only be once in the morning. Occasionally, life happens, and I can't get to it for a couple of days. This is the exception to the norm. Most people I chat with take 14-24 hours to respond anyways so this has not been a real issue. I've just noted that people are quicker to unmatch these days and was looking for some insight.

2) I love the suggestion of sending a quick ""Hey, I'm busy today, but I'll shoot you a message later"" rather than leaving someone hanging. 
","I understand where you're coming from, but I think it's important to consider that everyone has different communication styles and preferences. Some people may be more responsive than others due to their personal circumstances or comfort levels with texting. It might be helpful to consider that the timing of responses doesn't necessarily reflect the level of interest or compatibility. Additionally, it's possible that the women you're communicating with are also dealing with their own busy schedules and mental exhaustion. Perhaps trying to find common ground and understanding each other's communication styles could help build a stronger connection.",oppose
